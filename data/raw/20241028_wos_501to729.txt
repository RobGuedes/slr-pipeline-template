J	Avrahami, J; Güth, W; Kareev, Y; Ploner, M				Avrahami, Judith; Gueth, Werner; Kareev, Yaakov; Ploner, Matteo			Impulse balancing versus equilibrium learning an experimental study of competitive portfolio selection	EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW			English	Article						Impulse balancing; Probability matching; Regret; Portfolio management; Experiment	EVOLUTION	The experiment lets investors interact in portfolio choices involving different risky assets, one for each state of the world. Probabilities of random states are commonly known. All assets pay the same dividend when their state is realized and becomes worthless otherwise. Whereas evolutionary stability and equilibrium behavior predict equal expected profits across assets, impulse balancing (Selten and Buchta, Games and human behavior: essays in the Honor of Amnon Rapoport, 1999) equalizes the expected regret. Thus, impulse balancing seems to capture tendencies of cyclical direction learning. In addition to analyzing whether and when behavior converges to impulse balancing or to equilibrium portfolios, we categorize portfolio adaptation by path dependence and sensitivity to state-specific probabilities. We show that portfolio choices are driven mainly by probability matching, but the effect becomes weaker over time. Furthermore, most portfolio adjustments are not compatible with directional learning.

J	Baklanova, V; Kurkin, A; Teplova, T				Baklanova, Valeriia; Kurkin, Aleksei; Teplova, Tamara			Investor sentiment and the NFT hype index: to buy or not to buy?	CHINA FINANCE REVIEW INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						Non-fungible tokens (NFT); Investor sentiment indices; Natural language processing; Text analysis; Explainable artificial intelligence; C53; F37; G17; G41	REGRESSION	PurposeThe primary objective of this research is to provide a precise interpretation of the constructed machine learning model and produce definitive summaries that can evaluate the influence of investor sentiment on the overall sales of non-fungible token (NFT) assets. To achieve this objective, the NFT hype index was constructed as well as several approaches of XAI were employed to interpret Black Box models and assess the magnitude and direction of the impact of the features used.Design/methodology/approachThe research paper involved the construction of a sentiment index termed the NFT hype index, which aims to measure the influence of market actors within the NFT industry. This index was created by analyzing written content posted by 62 high-profile individuals and opinion leaders on the social media platform Twitter. The authors collected posts from the Twitter accounts that were afterward classified by tonality with a help of natural language processing model VADER. Then the machine learning methods and XAI approaches (feature importance, permutation importance and SHAP) were applied to explain the obtained results.FindingsThe built index was subjected to rigorous analysis using the gradient boosting regressor model and explainable AI techniques, which confirmed its significant explanatory power. Remarkably, the NFT hype index exhibited a higher degree of predictive accuracy compared to the well-known sentiment indices.Practical implicationsThe NFT hype index, constructed from Twitter textual data, functions as an innovative, sentiment-based indicator for investment decision-making in the NFT market. It offers investors unique insights into the market sentiment that can be used alongside conventional financial analysis techniques to enhance risk management, portfolio optimization and overall investment outcomes within the rapidly evolving NFT ecosystem. Thus, the index plays a crucial role in facilitating well-informed, data-driven investment decisions and ensuring a competitive edge in the digital assets market.Originality/valueThe authors developed a novel index of investor interest for NFT assets (NFT hype index) based on text messages posted by market influencers and compared it to conventional sentiment indices in terms of their explanatory power. With the application of explainable AI, it was shown that sentiment indices may perform as significant predictors for NFT sales and that the NFT hype index works best among all sentiment indices considered.

We used a large data set with 36 explanatory variables to compare the predictability of the DFEA with seven popular machine learning models and their mean combination method. The out-of-sample forecasting results showed that the DFEA statistically and economically outperforms all the competing models in terms of out-of-sample R square and success ratio. The DFEA also displayed sizable certainty equivalent return (CER) gains for a mean-variance investor in practice from an asset allocation perspective. Furthermore, we found that the predictive power of the DFEA stems from technical indicators, especially momentum predictors. Our results survived in various robustness checks.

J	Bhattacharya, A				Bhattacharya, Ayan			Hardness of Learning in Rich Environments and Some Consequences for Financial Markets	MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION			English	Article						learning; computational hardness; bounded rationality; market efficiency; high-frequency trading; rich environment		This paper examines the computational feasibility of the standard model of learning in economic theory. It is shown that the information update technique at the heart of this model is impossible to compute in all but the simplest scenarios. Specifically, using tools from theoretical machine learning, the paper first demonstrates that there is no polynomial implementation of the model unless the independence structure of variables in the data is publicly known. Next, it is shown that there cannot exist a polynomial algorithm to infer the independence structure; consequently, the overall learning problem does not have a polynomial implementation. Using the learning model when it is computationally infeasible carries risks, and some of these are explored in the latter part of the paper in the context of financial markets. Especially in rich, high-frequency environments, it implies discarding a lot of useful information, and this can lead to paradoxical outcomes in interactive game-theoretic situations. This is illustrated in a trading example where market prices can never reflect an informed trader's information, no matter how many rounds of trade.

J	Kurochkin, SV; Rodina, VA				Kurochkin, S. V.; Rodina, V. A.			Optimal solution for immunizing arbitrarily scheduled multiple liabilities	EKONOMIKA I MATEMATICESKIE METODY-ECONOMICS AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS			Russian	Article						ALM; immunization; interest rate risk; dispersion measure; Wasserstein distance; Monge-Kantorovich-Rubinstein; metric; EMD	IMMUNIZATION; RISK; DURATION; MANAGEMENT; PORTFOLIO; MODEL	Immunization, a control tool for interest rate dependent changes in the value of an asset portfolio given a similar dependency for a target liability portfolio, is central to portfolio management. A vast body of academic literature describes various immunization models either for the case of a single liability payout or assuming a specific change in the yield curve, or both. This paper is the first to propose an immunization solution for the case of multiple liability payouts assuming arbitrary changes in the yield curve. For the case of multiple liability payouts, we generalize M-Absolute, which is a risk measure proposed by Nawalkha. Chambers (1996), and estimate the proximity of payment streams with EMD (the Wasserstein distance) which is a well-known tool in machine learning. In line with Fong and Vasicek (1984), it is shown that portfolio's interest rate risk is constrained to a product of two factors with one factor, EMD between asset and liability streams, being only dependent on the portfolio structure and the other factor, the sup-norm of the function of interest rate shocks, being solely determined by changes in the yield curve. We also show the unimprovability of the estimate and obtain, in an explicit form, a computational procedure for the optimal immunizing portfolio. The results are practically applicable as exemplified by the immunization of an annuity-type security with a portfolio of government bonds.	[Kurochkin, S. V.; Rodina, V.

J	Ampountolas, A				Ampountolas, Apostolos			Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Commodity and Financial Markets: Insights from GARCH and SVR Models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						commodity markets; volatility; forecasting; FIGARCH; SVR; volatility forecast; cocoa futures; gold futures; GARCH models; machine learning	LONG-MEMORY; TIME-SERIES; VOLATILITY; OIL; VARIANCE; RISK	The aim of this study is to enhance the understanding of volatility dynamics in commodity returns, such as gold and cocoa, as well as the financial market index S&P500. It provides a comprehensive overview of each model's efficacy in capturing volatility clustering, asymmetry, and long-term memory effects in asset returns. By employing models like sGARCH, eGARCH, gjrGARCH, and FIGARCH, the research offers a nuanced understanding of volatility evolution and its impact on asset returns. Using the Skewed Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) in model optimization shows how important it is to understand asymmetry and fat-tailedness in return distributions, which are common in financial data. Key findings include the sGARCH model being the preferred choice for Gold Futures due to its lower AIC value and favorable parameter estimates, indicating significant volatility clustering and a slight positive skewness in return distribution. For Cocoa Futures, the FIGARCH model demonstrates superior performance in capturing long memory effects, as evidenced by its higher log-likelihood value and lower AIC value. For the S&P500 Index, the eGARCH model stands out for its ability to capture asymmetry in volatility responses, showing superior performance in both log-likelihood and AIC values. Overall, identifying superior modeling approaches like the FIGARCH model for long memory effects can enhance risk management strategies by providing more accurate estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). Additionally, the out-of-sample evaluation reveals that Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms traditional GARCH models for short-term forecasting horizons, indicating its potential as an alternative forecasting tool in financial markets. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate modeling techniques tailored to specific asset classes and forecasting horizons. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of advanced techniques like SVR in enhancing forecasting accuracy, thus offering valuable implications for portfolio management and risk assessment in financial markets.

This paper proposes to apply deep learning algorithms including deep neural network and deep autoencoder to track index performance and introduces a dynamic weight calculation method to measure the direct effects of the stocks on index. The empirical study takes historical data of Hang Seng Index (HSI) and its constituents to analyze the effectiveness and practicability of the index tracking method.

Based on observable information, a decision-maker learns about the unobservable factor while making investment-consumption decisions. Both factors are supposed to follow a mean-reverting process. Also, we relax the assumption for perfect liquidity of the risky asset through incorporating proportional transaction costs that are incurred in trading the risky asset. In such way, a form of friction posing liquidity risk to the investor is examined. Dynamic programming principle coupled with an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation are adopted to discuss the problem. Applying an asymptotic method with small transaction costs being taken as a perturbation parameter, we determine the frictional value function by solving the first and second corrector equations. For the numerical implementation of the proposed approach, a Monte-Carlosimulation-based approximation algorithm is adopted to solve the second corrector equation. Finally, numerical examples and their economic interpretations are discussed.

A neural network-based framework for financial model calibration	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						Computational finance; Machine learning; Artificial neural networks; Asset pricing model; Model calibration; Global optimization; Parallel computing	STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; IMPLIED VOLATILITY; INVERSE PROBLEM; APPROXIMATION; OPTIONS; BOUNDS	A data-driven approach called CaNN (Calibration Neural Network) is proposed to calibrate financial asset price models using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Determining optimal values of the model parameters is formulated as training hidden neurons within a machine learning framework, based on available financial option prices. The framework consists of two parts: a forward pass in which we train the weights of the ANN off-line, valuing options under many different asset model parameter settings; and a backward pass, in which we evaluate the trained ANN-solver on-line, aiming to find the weights of the neurons in the input layer. The rapid on-line learning of implied volatility by ANNs, in combination with the use of an adapted parallel global optimization method, tackles the computation bottleneck and provides a fast and reliable technique for calibrating model parameters while avoiding, as much as possible, getting stuck in local minima. Numerical experiments confirm that this machine-learning framework can be employed to calibrate parameters of high-dimensional stochastic volatility models efficiently and accurately.

J	Pohl, W; Schmedders, K; Wilms, O				Pohl, Walter; Schmedders, Karl; Wilms, Ole			Existence of the Wealth-Consumption Ratio in Asset Pricing Models with Recursive Preferences	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						C6; C62; G1; G10; G11; G12	LONG-RUN RISKS; GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM; RETURNS; UTILITY; AMBIGUITY; PREDICTABILITY; SUBSTITUTION; VOLATILITY; RESOLUTION; AVERSION	Modern asset pricing models combine recursive preferences with complex dynamics for the underlying consumption process. The existence of solutions is for many of these models an unsettled question. This paper introduces a novel technique to prove existence and nonexistence, as well as uniqueness for models with recursive preferences. The approach applies to many models of interest, including those with long-run consumption risks, with stochastic volatility and jumps, with time-varying consumption disasters, and with smooth ambiguity aversion and learning. Collectively, the proven results settle the existence question for many of today's leading asset pricing models.Authors have furnished an , which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online	[Pohl, Walter] NHH Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Schmedders, Karl] IMD Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wilms, Ole] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Wilms, Ole] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands	Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); International Institute for Management Development (IMD); University of Hamburg; Tilburg University	Wilms, O (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.; Wilms, O (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands.	ole.wilms@uni-hamburg.de	Schmedders, Karl/KHX-8311-2024	Schmedders, Karl/0000-0001-6887-0967; Wilms, Ole/0000-0001-9606-2289				Araujo A, 2011, J ECON THEORY, V146, P785, DOI 10.1016/j.jet.2011.01.005; Bansal R, 2004, J FINANC, V59, P1481, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00670.x; Bansal R, 2012, CRIT FINANC REV, V1, P183, DOI 10.1561/104.00000005; Bansal R, 2013, REV FINANC STUD, V26, P1, DOI 10.1093/rfs/hhs108; Becker R.

MACHINE LEARNING WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Forecasting; Machine learning; Random forests; Bitcoin; Gold; Inflation	INTERNATIONAL SIGN PREDICTABILITY; STOCK-MARKET; SAFE-HAVEN; COMMODITY PRICES; NEURAL-NETWORK; OIL PRICES; GOLD; RETURNS; HEDGE; RISK	Bitcoin has grown in popularity and has now attracted the attention of individual and institutional investors. Accurate Bitcoin price direction forecasts are important for determining the trend in Bitcoin prices and asset allocation. This paper addresses several unanswered questions. How important are business cycle variables like interest rates, inflation, and market volatility for forecasting Bitcoin prices? Does the importance of these variables change across time? Are the most important macroeconomic variables for forecasting Bitcoin prices the same as those for gold prices? To answer these questions, we utilize tree-based machine learning classifiers, along with traditional logit econometric models. The analysis reveals several important findings. First, random forests predict Bitcoin and gold price directions with a higher degree of accuracy than logit models. Prediction accuracy for bagging and random forests is between 75% and 80% for a five-day prediction. For 10-day to 20-day forecasts bagging and random forests record accuracies greater than 85%. Second, technical indicators are the most important features for predicting Bitcoin and gold price direction, suggesting some degree of market inefficiency. Third, oil price volatility is important for predicting Bitcoin and gold prices indicating that Bitcoin is a substitute for gold in diversifying this type of volatility. By comparison, gold prices are more influenced by inflation than Bitcoin prices, indicating that gold can be used as a hedge or diversification asset against inflation.

J	Winkler, F				Winkler, Fabian			The role of learning for asset prices and business cycles	JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Learning; Expectations; Financial frictions; Asset pricing; Survey forecasts	GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM; EXCESS VOLATILITY; DSGE MODEL; EXPECTATIONS; DYNAMICS; RETURNS; SHOCKS; US	The implications of learning-based asset pricing are examined in a business cycle model with financial frictions. Agents learn about stock prices while firms face credit constraints that depend partly on their market value. Expectations are constrained to remain modelconsistent conditional on a subjective belief for stock prices. The combination of financial frictions and learning amplifies shocks through a two-sided feedback mechanism between asset prices and real activity.

Problems of this type arise in a wide variety of applications, including portfolio optimization, learning of predictive models from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and source detection problems in electroencephalography. The use of parallel to Du parallel to(1) is aimed at encouraging structured sparsity in the solution. The subspaces where the acceleration is performed are selected so that the restriction of the objective function is a smooth function in a neighborhood of the current iterate. Numerical experiments for multi-period portfolio selection problems using real data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Dlotko, P; Qiu, W; Rudkin, ST				Dlotko, P.; Qiu, W.; Rudkin, S. T.			Financial ratios and stock returns reappraised through a topological data analysis lens	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE			English	Article						Stock returns; anomalies; topological data analysis; data science; mispricing	CROSS-SECTION; COMMON-STOCKS; RISK; MONOTONICITY; EQUILIBRIUM; PRICES	Firm financials are well-established predictors of stock returns, being the basis for both the traditional econometric, and growing Machine Learning, asset pricing literature. Employing topological data analysis ball mapper (TDABM), we revisit the association between seven of the most commonly studied financial ratios and stock returns. Upon outlining the methodology to the finance literature, this paper offers three key contributions to the study of asset pricing. Firstly, the characteristic space is visualised to showcase non-monotonic relationships in multiple dimensions that were as yet unseen. Secondly, the means through which neural networks and random forest regressions fit stock returns is also visualised, showing where Machine Learning is contributing to understanding. Finally, an initial application of TDABM for the segmentation of the cross-section is posited, with significant abnormal returns identified. Collectively these three expositions signpost the value of TDABM for financial researchers and practitioners alike. The scope for benefit is limited only by the availability of information to the analyst.

J	Shin, M				Shin, Michael			ENDOGENOUS PARTICIPATION, RISK, AND LEARNING IN THE STOCK MARKET	MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS			English	Article						Stock Market Participation; Adaptive Learning; Excess Volatility; Asset Pricing	ASSET PRICES; VOLATILITY; EXPECTATIONS; CONVERGENCE; ELASTICITY; BUBBLES; MODEL; LABOR	A simple asset pricing model with both endogenous stock market participation and subjective risk can explain the negative cross-country correlation between participation rates and the volatility of excess returns, along with the time-varying participation rates in the data. Belief-driven learning dynamics can explain the interplay between participation rates, subjective risk, and stock price volatility. When agents adaptively learn about the risk and return, my model generates 25% of the excess volatility observed in US stock prices, while also matching key moments. With learning about risk, excess volatility of stock prices is driven by fluctuations in the participation rate that arise because agents' risk estimates vary with prices. I find that learning about risk is quantitatively more important than learning about returns.

J	Babaei, G; Bamdad, S				Babaei, Golnoosh; Bamdad, Shahrooz			A neural-network-based decision-making model in the peer-to-peer lending market	INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN ACCOUNTING FINANCE & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						net present value; peer-to-peer lending; portfolio optimization	RISK-ASSESSMENT; IMBALANCED DATA; CREDIT RISK	This study proposes an investment recommendation model for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. P2P lenders usually are inexpert, so helping them to make the best decision for their investments is vital. In this study, while we aim to compare the performance of different artificial neural network (ANN) models, we evaluate loans from two perspectives: risk and return. The net present value (NPV) is considered as the return variable. To the best of our knowledge, NPV has been used in few studies in the P2P lending context. Considering the advantages of using NPV, we aim to improve decision-making models in this market by the use of NPV and the integration of supervised learning and optimization algorithms that can be considered as one of our contributions. In order to predict NPV, three ANN models are compared concerning mean square error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to find the optimal ANN model. Furthermore, for the risk evaluation, the probability of default of loans is computed using logistic regression. Investors in the P2P lending market can share their assets between different loans, so the procedure of P2P investment is similar to portfolio optimization. In this context, we minimize the risk of a portfolio for a minimum acceptable level of return. To analyse the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compare our decision-making algorithm with the output of a traditional model. The experimental results on a real-world data set show that our model leads to a better investment concerning both risk and return.

Many individuals and organizations try to improve their performance in these markets by exploiting approaches that consider different types of factors. However, although there are great complexities involved, practitioners often use simplistic methodologies that neglect relevant features of the problem. That is, they leave out some activities that are essential to obtain better results in the related decision-making problem. Here, we propose to use a soft computing-based approach to comprehensively address the main activities of stock investments. We present a novel method for modeling expert knowledge through fuzzy logic that allows the investor to discard undesirable stocks (i.e., stocks that are not suitable for investment); thus, reducing computational complexity in the search process and likely improving the performance of the final stock portfolio. Extensive experiments allowed us to conclude that discarding undesirable stocks by exploiting the proposed method produces portfolios that outperform the benchmarks. Therefore, the proposal is a promising alternative to complement current approaches.

We develop a new framework to rigorously perform multiple hypothesis testing in linear asset pricing models, while limiting the occurrence of false positive results typically associated with data snooping. By exploiting a variety of machine learning techniques, our multiple-testing procedure is robust to omitted factors and missing data. We also prove its asymptotic validity when the number of tests is large relative to the sample size, as in many finance applications. To improve the finite sample performance, we also provide a wild-bootstrap procedure for inference and prove its validity in this setting. Finally, we illustrate the empirical relevance in the context of hedge fund performance evaluation.

More than a third of cluster portfolios remain significant under the Hou et al. (2020) five-factor model - the best performing among six benchmark models tested. A best-first search yields nine factors that subsume all cluster portfolios as well as all significant anomalies, demonstrating the feasibility of a parsimonious description of average realised returns. The expected growth factor (EG) and a cluster portfolio linked to accruals are prominent factors that improve pricing performance. The search-generated model produces a monthly maximum squared Sharpe ratio of 0.51, considerably higher than current benchmark models. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Karolyi, GA; Van Nieuwerburgh, S				Karolyi, G. Andrew; Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn			New Methods for the Cross-Section of Returns	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article							PRESIDENTIAL-ADDRESS; MARKET VALUE; RISK; ANOMALIES	The cross-section and time series of stock returns contains a wealth of information about the stochastic discount factor (SDF), the object that links cash flows to prices. A large empirical literature has uncovered many candidate factors-many more than seem plausible-to summarize the SDF. This special volume of the Review of Financial Studies presents recent advances in extracting information from both the cross-section and the time series, in dealing with issues of replication and false discoveries, and in applying innovative machine-learning techniques to identify the most relevant asset pricing factors. Our editorial summarizes what we learn and offers a few suggestions to guide future work in this exciting new era of big data and empirical asset pricing.	[Karolyi, G.

J	Cheng, E; Struck, CC				Cheng, Enoch; Struck, Clemens C.			Antinoise in US equity markets	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE			English	Article						Noise traders; Behavioral economics; Machine learning; Asset pricing	CROSS-SECTION; CORRELATION-MATRICES; FINANCIAL-MARKETS; BEHAVIOR; HERD; PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT; MODEL	There are many well documented behavioral biases in financial markets. Yet, analyzing U.S. equities reveals that less than 1% of returns are predictable in recent years. Given the high number of biases, why are returns not more predictable? We provide new evidence in support of one possible explanation. In the long-run, low correlations across signals that trigger biases may create sufficient antinoise which mutes more sizable patterns in returns. However, in the short-run, correlation spikes coincide with market volatility indicating that behavioral biases may become more visible during crises.

To do this, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations method (SHAP) to interpret the results obtained by XGBoost. We find that the factors have different impacts on portfolio returns and interact with each other in different ways. We also find that the average impacts of factors on portfolio returns are similar before and after the publication of the three-factor model and the 2008 financial crisis but the interactions between factors vary across times.

Most of existing studies assumed that the investor has all the cash in hand and no securities position before portfolio optimization, which is sometimes inconsistent to reality. Besides, many studies are based on expected utility theory, which is in conflict with the behavior of some investors and may also lead to over-concentration of capital. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy portfolio selection model based on three-way decision and cumulative prospect theory, which can mitigate the two shortcomings mentioned above. In this model, every action in the action set to the candidate securities is assigned to a prospect value and we can construct a tri-partition of the candidate securities according to three-way decision theory. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we adopted two case studies on the basis of real market data. The experimented results prove that the using of three-way decision and cumulative prospect theory increases the investment return, meanwhile, reduces the risk for the investor.

J	Wu, ZY; Nip, KM; He, Q				Wu, Zeyang; Nip, Kameng; He, Qie			A New Combinatorial Algorithm for Separable Convex Resource Allocation with Nested Bound Constraints	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						resource allocation; constraint relaxation; divide and conquer; polynomial-time algorithms; mixed-integer convex optimization	SPEED OPTIMIZATION; SELECTION; OIL	The separable convex resource allocation problem with nested bound constraints aims to allocate B units of resources to n activities to minimize a separable convex cost function, with lower and upper bounds on the total amount of resources that can be consumed by nested subsets of activities. We develop a new combinatorial algorithm to solve this model exactly. Our algorithm is capable of solving instances with millions of activities in several minutes. The running time of our algorithm is at most 73% of the running time of the current best algorithm for benchmark instances with three classes of convex objectives. The efficiency of our algorithm derives from a combination of constraint relaxation and divide and conquer based on infeasibility information. In particular, nested bound constraints are relaxed first; if the solution obtained violates some bound constraints, we show that the problem can be divided into two subproblems of the same structure and smaller sizes according to the bound constraint with the largest violation. Summary of Contribution. The resource allocation problem is a collection of optimization models with a wide range of applications in production planning, logistics, portfolio management, telecommunications, statistical surveys, and machine learning. This paper studies the resource allocation model with prescribed lower and upper bounds on the total amount of resources consumed by nested subsets of activities. These nested bound constraints are motivated by storage limits, time-window requirements, and budget constraints in various applications. The model also appears as a subproblem in models for green logistics and machine learning, and it has to be solved repeatedly. The model belongs to the class of computationally challenging convex mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We develop a combinatorial algorithm to solve this model exactly. Our algorithm is faster than the algorithm that currently has the best theoretical complexity in the literature on an extensive set of test instances. The efficiency of our algorithm derives from the combination of an infeasibility-guided divide-and-conquer framework and a scaling-based greedy subroutine for resource allocation with submodular constraints. This paper also showcases the prevalent mismatch between the theoretical worst-case time complexity of an algorithm and its practical efficiency. We have offered some explanations of this mismatch through the perspectives of worst-case analysis, specially designed instances, and statistical metrics of numerical experiments. The implementation of our algorithm is available on an online repository.

Peer-to-peer bilateral transactions avoid broker fees but involve challenges of balancing between cooperative and competitive strategies for multi-round negotiations. To solve these challenges, this paper develops novel utility-based and adaptive agent-tracking strategies for bilateral negotiations. Relying on bilateral transaction volume and utility curves determined over a price range during unilateral pre-negotiation, utility-based strategies are developed for generation company (GenCo) agent (load serving entity (LSE) agent) to offer (bid) volumes and prices during multi-round bilateral negotiations. GenCo agent is also equipped with a new adaptive agent-tracking strategy that estimates reservation price of each LSE agent by Bayesian learning and updates the estimates in each round. The adaptive agent-tracking strategy facilitates cooperative yet competitive responses. Integration of new bilateral negotiation strategies with existing day-ahead auction in a renowned agent-based platform also enables combined simulation of the two market types. The case study demonstrates that the adaptive agent-tracking strategy empowers GenCoagents to swing bilateral negotiation results in their favor and yield 7% more payoff than the utility-based strategy, while achieving 100% improvement in frequency of failure of negotiation.

J	Wang, JH; Micale, JA				Wang, Jinghua; Micale, Joseph A.			What happens when the disruptive asset meets the conventional asset? An analysis of cryptocurrency and REIT	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						REIT; cryptocurrency; wavelet multiresolution analysis; granger causality; machine learning; lightGBM; C32; C58; C63; G12; Q0	BITCOIN; RISK; VOLATILITY; PREDICTABILITY; DEPENDENCE; SPILLOVER; INFLATION; PRICES; GROWTH; CHINA	This study investigates the symmetric and asymmetric connectedness of recently developed disruptive assets - cryptocurrency and important conventional assets - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) across various time scales and frequencies. We measure the strength and magnitude of returns and volatility spillover between REITs and cryptocurrency using both time series and machine learning approaches. Our findings support the dominance of conventional assets in the correlation with disruptive assets, demonstrated by REITs price movements' destabilization of the correlation network. Interestingly, this destabilization is concentrated in bear markets, suggesting that while investors trade both cryptocurrencies and REITs in bull markets, investors are likely to hedge their cryptocurrency investments with REITs or avoid cryptocurrencies in bear markets. Our empirical findings provide implications for both asset allocation and policy making.

The nonlinear machine learning models generate statistically and economically sizable profits in the long-short portfolios of equity options even after accounting for transaction costs. Although option-based characteristics are the most important standalone predictors, stock-based measures offer substantial incremental predictive power when considered alongside option-based characteristics. Finally, we provide compelling evidence that option return predictability is driven by informational frictions and option mispricing.

J	Tortorice, DL				Tortorice, Daniel L.			Long-Run Expectations, Learning and the US Housing Market	EASTERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article						Learning; Expectations; Housing demand; Asset pricing	MONETARY-POLICY; PRICE DYNAMICS; HOME EQUITY; TIME; CYCLE; CONSUMPTION; MODEL; CONSTRAINTS; SEARCH; BOOMS	In the US housing market, the price-to-rent ratio is volatile and autocorrelated. Returns on housing are positively autocorrelated. The price-to-rent ratio is negatively correlated with future returns and rent growth. Housing returns exhibit time-varying volatility. A benchmark asset pricing model is inconsistent with these facts. A model where prices adjust slowly to their fundamental value and where the agent does not know whether housing fundamentals are trend or difference stationary so has changing beliefs over time, increases the volatility of prices and the autocorrelation of returns. The price-to-rent ratio negatively forecasts returns and rent growth. This model generates time-varying volatility.

J	Andrei, D; Hasler, M; Jeanneret, A				Andrei, Daniel; Hasler, Michael; Jeanneret, Alexandre			Asset Pricing with Persistence Risk	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article							LONG-RUN RISK; EXPECTED STOCK RETURNS; PREDICTIVE REGRESSIONS; DIVIDEND YIELDS; TERM STRUCTURE; CONSUMPTION; UNCERTAINTY; TIME; MODEL	Persistence risk is an endogenous source of risk that arises when a rational agent learns about the length of business cycles. Persistence risk is positive during recessions and negative during expansions. This asymmetry, which solely results from learning about persistence, causes expected returns, return volatility, and the price of risk to rise during recessions. Persistence risk predicts future excess returns, particularly at 3- to 7-year horizons. Its predictability is strongest around business-cycle peaks and troughs. We confirm the model's predictions in the data and provide evidence that persistence risk is priced in financial markets.

To overcome the exponential barrier, we develop an efficient, scalable algorithm by employing a feedforward neural network. A novel concept is to apply HJB equations as an advanced start for the neural network. Empirical tests with several practical examples, including a portfolio of 48 correlated pair trades over 50 time steps, show the advantages of the approach in a high-dimensional setting. We conjecture that other financial optimization problems are amenable to similar approaches.

J	Yan, S; Zhou, YD; Zhang, YL				Yan, Shi; Zhou, Yaodong; Zhang, Youlu			Analysis of Balance of Income and Expenditure and Optimal Retirement Age of Pension Insurance Co-Ordination Account Based on Improved Machine Learning Algorithm	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ASSET ALLOCATION; SCHEMES; REFORM	Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the issue of aging has gained international attention. Both developed and developing nations are currently dealing with this issue. To ensure the sustained and healthy growth of the economy and society in the face of an aging society, it is especially important to establish a scientific old-age insurance system and a reasonable retirement system. We are all aware that the key indicators for the state to control the old-age insurance system in the old-age insurance system are the income and expenditure balance of the old-age insurance pooling account and the analysis of the ideal retirement age. In this paper, a better machine algorithm is used. By independently learning the rules present in a large amount of data and gaining new experience and knowledge, machine learning (ML) can increase computer intelligence and give computers decision-making abilities comparable to those of humans. In general, a machine learning algorithm uses the laws it derives from data to predict unknown data after automatically analysing the data. This study's findings suggest that the ideal retirement age and life expectancy are positively correlated, with the ideal retirement age's growth rate 12.57 percent higher than that of life expectancy.

We find that hedge funds with the highest level of automation outperform other hedge funds with more reliance on human involvement. Also, we find that a man versus machine zero-cost strategy that is long hedge funds portfolio with highest level of automation and short those with highest level of human involvement yields a highly significant spread of at least 50 basis points per month. We conclude that automation plays an important role in the profitability of the hedge fund industry.

Bayesian beliefs about this parameter are updated from firms' and industry peers' comovement between their productivity and consumption growth. The model implies that discount rates rise endogenously with the perceived risk exposure of firms, thereby depressing investment and valuation ratios. We test these predictions in the data and find strong support for them. We also confirm that cross-sectional learning from peers is crucial and that alternative Bayesian risk estimates, which ignore peer observations, do not predict firm variables.

J	Zhu, M; Zheng, SY; Guo, Y; Song, YP				Zhu, Min; Zheng, Siyue; Guo, Yu; Song, Yuping			Energy price prediction based on decomposed price dynamics: A parallel neural network approach	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Energy price forecasting; Parallel Hybrid Neural Network model; Event tracking indicators; Deep learning		The growing uncertainties of the world due to geographic tensions, and weather conditions challenge the traditional method to achieve a reliable price prediction of energy future for both asset pricing and risk management. Following the initial success of deep learning models in energy price prediction, we attempt to establish a better architecture of neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy. We propose a novel Parallel Hybrid Neural Network (PHNN) model that utilizes independent sub-networks to effectively capture the distinct features of various sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the PHNN model exhibits a significant performance enhancement of 16.68%, 14.09%, and 2.34% over the EMD-LSTM, the informer model, and the single LSTM model, respectively. In particular, the PHNN outperforms the single LSTM, which is trained on the same inputs, by 2.34% overall while by a remarkable 4.11% during event periods. This suggests that the PHNN derives notable benefits from its distinct architecture, particularly during the initial phase of extreme events characterized by significant price trend changes. Additionally, the study explores the potential benefits of incorporating additional event-tracking indicators for energy futures price forecasting. However, the findings suggest that these indicators may not consistently provide effective complementary information.

To realize the optimal asset allocation on investor's risk aversion, various portfolio construction methods have been proposed. Recently, the applications of machine learning are rapidly growing in the area of finance. In this article, we propose the Student's t-process latent variable model (TPLVM) to describe non-Gaussian fluctuations of financial timeseries by lower dimensional latent variables. Subsequently, we apply the TPLVM to portfolio construction as an alternative of existing nonlinear factor models. To test the performance of the proposed method, we construct minimum-variance portfolios of global stock market indices based on the TPLVM or Gaussian process latent variable model. By comparing these portfolios, we confirm the proposed portfolio outperforms that of the existing Gaussian process latent variable model.

JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access							PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; MARKOWITZ; ESTIMATOR; SELECTION; VARIANCE; RETURNS	We show theoretically that the usual estimated investment strategies will not achieve the optimal Sharpe ratio when the dimensionality is high relative to sample size, and the 1/N rule is optimal in a 1-factor model with diversifiable risks as dimensionality increases, which explains why it is difficult to beat the 1/N rule in practice. We also explore conditions under which it can be beaten, and find that we can outperform it by combining it with the estimated rules when N is small, and by combining it with anomalies or machine learning portfolios, conditional on the profitability of the latter, when N is large.

Our findings suggest statistics derived from message volume and sentiment can improve asset price forecasts and leads to a profitable trading strategy.

Neural network embeddings on corporate annual filings for portfolio selection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Neural network embedding; Document embedding; Machine learning; Asset pricing; Inattention; Annual reports	FINANCIAL NEWS; PREDICTION	In recent years, there has been an increased interest from both academics and practitioners in automatically analyzing the textual part of companies' financial reports to extract meaning rich in information for future outcomes. In particular, tracking textual changes among companies' reports can have a large and significant impact on stock prices. This impact happens with a lag implying that investors only gradually realize the implications of the news hinted by document changes. However, the length of these documents as well as their complexity in terms of structure and language have been increasing dramatically making this process more and more difficult to perform. In this paper, we analyzed how to face this complexity by learning arbitrary dimensional vector representations for US corporate filings (10-Ks) from 1998 to 2018, exploiting and comparing different neural network embedding techniques which take into account words' semantics through vectors proximity. We also compared their ability to capture changes associated with future risk-adjusted abnormal returns with other more commonly used approaches in literature. Finally, we propose a novel investment strategy named Semantic Similarity Portfolio (SSP) that exploits these neural network embeddings. We show that firms that do not change their 10-Ks in a semantically important way from the previous year tend to have large and statistically significant future risk-adjusted abnormal returns. We, also document an amplifying effect when we incorporate a momentum-related criterion, where the companies selected must also have had positive previous year returns.

ITI increases before earnings, mergers and acquisitions, and news announcements, and has implications for return reversal and asset pricing. ITI is effective because it captures nonlinearities and interactions between informed trading, volume, and volatility. This data-driven approach can shed light on the economics of informed trading, including impatient informed trading, commonality in informed trading, and models of informed trading. Overall, learning from informed trading data can generate an effective informed trading measure.

J	Eliasy, A; Przychodzen, J				Eliasy, Ashkan; Przychodzen, Justyna			The role of AI in capital structure to enhance corporate funding strategies	ARRAY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Capital structure; Investment; CAPM (expected returns); Neural network; Cost of capital	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; STOCK-MARKET; TIME-SERIES; MULTIPLE-REGRESSION; MODEL; RISK; BETA; CAPM; EQUILIBRIUM; PREDICTION	The purpose of this study was to assess if Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and whether the use of AI could bring a more accurate estimation of expected returns. Cost of capital defines the minimum return expected from any investment made by a firm. Hence for managers to maximise the value of the corporation, it is essential to have an accurate estimation of the cost of capital.For the purpose of analysing securities, the adjusted closing stock prices of 10 high-tech public companies were studied from January 2013 to January 2019. This research assumed that there is a need to predict returns for the next year. Hence one year of historical data was used to calculate traditional CAPM value and also train the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict stock prices of the upcoming year. A generic deep learning network architecture was developed with the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and dropout layers. After calculating the returns using traditional and AI approaches, two methods for calculation of CAPM were proposed and compared.Following the analysis, it was found that the use of AI improved the accuracy of cost of equity estimations by over 60%. The strong ability of the selected deep learning neural network to predict stock prices, increased the accuracy of estimating returns by at least 18%.

J	Aras, S				Aras, Serkan			On improving GARCH volatility forecasts for Bitcoin via a meta-learning approach	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Volatility; Bitcoin; Model Confidence Set; Combining forecasts; GARCH	REALIZED VOLATILITY; ANYTHING BEAT; CRYPTOCURRENCIES; MODELS; RETURN; DOLLAR; PRICE; GOLD	Modelling the volatility of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the largest market share, has recently attracted considerable attention from researchers, practitioners and investors in financial markets and portfolio management. For this purpose, a wide variety of GARCH-type models have been employed. However, there is no consensus in the literature on which specification arising from the volatility equation and the assumed error distribution is better in an out-of-sample performance. This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning. The results indicate that the best performing GARCH specification depends on the loss function chosen, and the proposed method leads to more accurate volatility forecasts than those of the best GARCH-type models and other combining methods investigated.

J	Citron, GP				Citron, Gary P.			Performance tracking: A historical background to promote learning	AAPG BULLETIN			English	Article								This geologic note provides a lookback on lookbacks, hopefully to spur further interest by companies in generating learning from exploration experience, rather than being victimized by repeated mistakes to which exploration assessment may unknowingly be exposed. The lookback contribution to portfolio management is properly called performance tracking. Likely inspired by the after-action review process installed by the US Army approximately 50 yr ago, oil industry published results of tracking predictive performance began via a simple cross plot (predrill prospect resource size versus postdrill accumulation resource size) by US Geological Survey (USGS) workers documenting discovery sizes on the United States continental shelf. Whereas predrill estimates made by the USGS were relatively accurate, analogous publications by the industry have usually documented recurring optimistic bias. Other contributions have demonstrated the utility of determining (1) the efficiency of prospect ranking by various predrill estimation parameters (via an estimation efficiency plot), (2) when a drilling program falls outside of statistical control (via a sequential aggregation plot), and (3) where along a series of predrill forecast distributions persistent estimation bias has occurred (via a percentile histogram). These basics can serve as a starting point for any company to build their own baseline study to learn what aspects of their many estimates need improvement.

Using their measure, they investigate the effect of cybersecurity risk on firm-level return volatility; they examine both idiosyncratic volatility and implied volatility and find that firm-level cybersecurity risk is positively correlated to idiosyncratic volatility on the days on which earnings calls are held. This suggests that the discussion of issues related to cybersecurity risk during earnings calls is related to an increase in the component of the volatility that responds only to firm-specific news. That positive relationship is robust to alternative measurements of the language in earnings call discussions and to industry classifications.

J	Kopányi, D; Rabanal, JP; Rud, OA; Tuinstra, J				Kopanyi, David; Rabanal, Jean Paul; Rud, Olga A.; Tuinstra, Jan			Can competition between forecasters stabilize asset prices in learning to forecast experiments?	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL			English	Article						Experimental finance; Market impact; Expectation formation; Asset pricing; Learning to forecast	EXPECTATIONS FEEDBACK; RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; VOLATILITY; MARKETS; GAMES; RISK	We conduct a learning to forecast asset pricing experiment that assumes that financial advisors and professional forecasters attract more investors when their price forecasts are more accurate. The competition between forecasters implies that the impact of their forecasts on realized market prices evolves endogenously. We investigate how these endogenous impacts affect price dispersion and mispricing relative to the fundamental price. Our results show that the effect of endogenous impacts depends on (i) the type of market dynamics (stable/unstable) and (ii) the sensitivity of impacts with respect to forecast accuracy (low/high). Compared to the baseline treatment, where impacts are constant and independent of forecast accuracy, price dispersion and mispricing is somewhat lower in stable markets when impacts are moderately sensitive to forecast accuracy. In contrast, impacts that are strongly sensitive to forecast accuracy can further destabilize unstable markets, amplifying price dispersion and mispricing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a commodity, it is unavoidable to emphasize its export performance by forecasting. This paper aims to bring out an Artificial Neural Network based model to predict India's leather footwear export. Towards forecasting Leather footwear export, the dataset comprising five commodities covered under leather footwear has been taken from 1996 to 97 to 2021-22. The authors have proposed India's Leather Footwear Export -Artificial Neural Network (ILFE-ANN) model with SGD optimizer and activation functions such as Sigmoid / Logistic and Rectified linear unit (ReLU). The authors have kept null values as it is in the data than replacing them with imputation methods such as mean and median while modelling. Outliers are replaced with the mean value of the remaining data before modelling. Moreover, different learning algorithms such as Adaptive Moment (Adam), RMS Propagation (RMSProp), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and SGD with Momentum (SGDM) have been compared to choose an optimal one before being implemented in the ILFE-ANN. The vali-dation of the ILFE-ANN model has been implemented for the prediction of livestock population and compared with the Regression model. The variation percentage confirms that the proposed ILFE-ANN model performs significantly with 0.51% RMSProp, 1.68 % SGDM and 2.54 % SGD. Further, the minimum value of performance metrics MAE, MAPE and RMSE obtained are 0.4, 0.5 and 0.5 respectively for the prediction of sheep population for the year 2017. It shows that SGD performs better with the least error rate of 8% MAPE for the export of leather Commodity 64035113. Hence, the study confirms that the ANN model with SGD optimizer performs better for the prediction of India's leather footwear trade data.

Sreenivasa			Trusty URI learning-based secure blockchain management for making verifiable and reliable digital artifacts	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Verifiable; Digital artifacts; Digital object identification; Block chain; E-portfolio management framework; Credential verifier; Resource description framework		E-portfolios, or electronic portfolios, have recently gained popularity as a means for students and continuous learners to present their skills, accomplishments, and other relevant information in an online format. To confirm learning outcomes, e-portfolios need secure, dependable, and privacy-protecting systems for issuing and verifying credentials. When any client changes their document, designs present in help are altered, and it is imperative to refresh them in setup data handling frameworks. Considering the unchanging nature of the text, it is a mind-boggling undertaking to refresh the changed substance in web-related applications. Making computerized antiques is one of the significant issues to be evident and solid in updated content. Existing frameworks give private organizations comprehensive, concentrated arrangements that depend on trusted outsiders to issue and confirm accreditations. In addition, they need to give students the tools to take ownership of and share the material in their e-portfolios with other organizations, which increases the potential for forgery and bogus credentials. This paper proposes the Trusty URI Learning-Based Secure Blockchain Management Schema (TURILSBMS). This framework ensures the legitimacy and uprightness of client certifications. What is more, the information relates to an e-portfolio. While unquestionable cases are used for e-portfolio qualification evidence confirmation and check, decentralized IDs and undeniable certificates are used for client profile differentiating proof, verification, and approval. We have planned and carried out a model of the proposed plot utilizing a Quorum consortium blockchain network. Considering the assessments, our arrangement is attainable, secure, and protective. Compared to traditional approaches, the proposed approach gives better privacy-based immutable digital artifact creation over nanopublication.

In addition to spot prices, we incorporate 127 macroeconomic and 598 energy information characteristics to extract the factor loadings. The empirical results demonstrate the high-quality performance of the model in out-of-sample testing. Furthermore, by analyzing characteristic importance, we find that energy information characteristics, particularly coal, electricity, and crude oil and natural gas resource development, play a dominant role in explaining the excess returns of energy commodities.

They use an up-to-date dataset and enhance it to account for missing valuations using machine learning. They infer, with a median error of less than 4%, the true log value of the firm for a total of nearly 120,000 observations from 2010 to 2022. They find an annualized expected return of around 38%, an annualized CAPM alpha of 32.14%, a beta of 1.37, and an idiosyncratic risk of 40%.

J	Padysak, M				Padysak, Matus			PREDICTION-BASED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES IN EUROPEAN BOND MARKETS	AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH			English	Article						corporate bonds; credit spread; machine learning; asset allocation; investing strategy	SKEWNESS; RISK	Daily returns of the European corporate bond market are predicted using a penalized Lasso regression or Random forests. Predictions are utilized in investment strategies that allocate resources into risky position: interest-rate hedged corporate bonds or unhedged corporate bonds and risk-free position proxied by the Euro-Bobl futures that track the German government bonds. The strategies are more profitable with a lower risk than their passive alternatives, which only invest in corporate bonds (hedged or unhedged), but the daily rebalancing can be costly. Therefore, we examine the break-even transaction costs and suggest two approaches to lower the overall costs. Overall, even with costs, active strategies based on prediction can achieve higher returns with a lower risk.

J	Liu, HN; Zhang, YZ				Liu, Hening; Zhang, Yuzhao			Financial Uncertainty with Ambiguity and Learning	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						ambiguity; business cycle; Markov switching; production-based asset pricing; uncertainty; variance risk premium	LONG-RUN RISK; EQUITY PREMIUM; LABOR MARGIN; MARKET PRICE; ASSET; AVERSION; RETURNS; EQUILIBRIUM; SHOCKS	We examine a production-based asset pricing model with regime-switching productivity growth, learning, and ambiguity. Both the mean and volatility of the growth rate of productivity are assumed to follow a Markov chain with an unobservable state. The agent's preferences are characterized by the generalized recursive smooth ambiguity utility function. Our calibrated benchmark model with modest risk aversion can match moments of the variance risk premium in the data and reconcile empirical relations between the risk neutral variance and macroeconomic quantities and their respective volatilities. We show that the interplay between productivity volatility risk and ambiguity aversion is important for pricing variance risk in returns.

J	Kara, M; Ulucan, A; Atici, KB				Kara, Mahmut; Ulucan, Aydin; Atici, Kazim Baris			A hybrid approach for generating investor views in Black-Litterman model	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Portfolio optimization; Black-Litterman model; Support vector regression; GARCH modeling	PORTFOLIO SELECTION	One of the main contributions of Black-Litterman asset allocation modeling is bringing out the idea of updating portfolios relying on the investor views. The incorporation of such views may inject subjectivity to the modeling phase. There is a recent literature on generating the views with financial forecasting methods, which employ either econometric or learning algorithms. In this research, we aim to propose a hybrid approach to the stream, in which GARCH modeling is used for predicting indicators for the stocks, followed by translating the indicator forecasts to return forecasts through Support Vector Regression. The obtained return forecasts are then fed into Black-Litterman modeling as investor views vector in order to generate portfolios with rolling data. The proposed model is tested in two markets: an emerging market (BIST-30 index of Istanbul Stock Exchange) and a developed market (Dow Jones Index of US Stock Market). In general, the results reveal better portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios than the index return for different holding periods, as well as better portfolio returns than randomly generated portfolios. We further show that the indicators can be accounted relying on the state or the market (non-trending or trending). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An investor observes technology shocks that follow a regime-switching process but does not know the underlying model parameters governing the short -term and long-run perspectives of economic growth. We show that rational belief updating endogenously generates long-run risks that help explain various asset pricing facts, most prominently, dividend yield variance decomposition. The asset pricing implications of endogenous long-run risks depend crucially on the introduction of a procyclical dividend process.

We find that ISI is positively correlated with future stock market returns at a monthly frequency, but negatively associated with subsequent returns over a longer horizon. Moreover, ISI outperforms other well-recognized predictors both in and out of sample, and can predict cross-sectional stock returns sorted by industry. We also show a positive association between monthly ISI and dividend growth rate, which indicates that investors' expectations about future cash flows may contribute to the return predictability of ISI.

J	Silva, JCS; de Almeida, AT				Soares Silva, Julio Cezar; de Almeida Filho, Adiel Teixeira			Interactively Learning Rough Strategies That Dynamically Satisfy Investor's Preferences in Multiobjective Index Tracking	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Portfolios; Indexes; Optimization; Evolutionary computation; Costs; Process control; Minimization; Dominance-based rough set approach; evolutionary algorithm; index tracking; interactive multiobjective optimization; portfolio optimization	PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; COGNITIVE LOAD; TIME; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; ROBUST	Multiobjective index tracking models optimize portfolios considering investors' desire to replicate or outperform a market index. It is possible to search for the best portfolio in the optimal Pareto Front for a given investor with interactive multiobjective optimization using dominance-based rough sets approach (IMO-DRSA). However, obtaining the optimal Pareto front can be impractical as the index size grows. Therefore, evolutionary multiobjective approaches (EMO) can be used to find good fronts in a reasonable time. A simulated IMO-DRSA approach was adopted and extended to offer insights on how to design interactive processes for index tracking considering the stochastic output of EMO. The extended simulated IMO-DRSA approach analyzes how different factors, such as the number of interactions and methods for cognitive effort reduction, affect the capacity of an EMO to produce good portfolios for different types of artificial investors during interactions and to maintain their goodness over time. In contrast to previous studies, this research explores various approaches for displaying potential portfolios to investors and investigates the performance of an evolutionary algorithm guided by IMO-DRSA in multiple problem instances with an increased number of objectives.

J	Saleemi, J				Saleemi, Jawad			COVID-19 and liquidity risk, exploring the relationship dynamics between liquidity cost and stock market returns	NATIONAL ACCOUNTING REVIEW			English	Article						asset pricing; liquidity cost; stock market returns; Covid-19 impact		The impact on economic aspects of the COVID-19 is continuing under discussion. This study unveils effects of the pandemic on relationship dynamics between liquidity cost and stock market returns. Using the time series and machine learning techniques, the analysis is based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) index. If the entire dataset was examined, the liquidity cost was found to be positive and significantly related to the DJI index returns. From the VAR estimation, the market returns were significantly explained by past values of the liquidity cost. The statistical Granger-causality was also observed between variables. If the relationship was analyzed during peak restrictions, the results were changed. The liquidity cost was observed to be negative and insignificantly related to the DJI index returns. The market returns were not associated with lags of the liquidity cost. In addition, the Granger-causality was not found between variables. If effects associated with easing restrictions were examined, the liquidity cost was found to be positive and significantly associated with returns on the DJI index. Meanwhile, the returns were more sensitive to the liquidity cost. However, the market returns were not explained by lags of the liquidity cost. The liquidity cost did not Granger-cause returns. The findings suggest that the liquidity cost must be priced in returns due to the pandemic-related uncertainty.

J	Barroso, P; Saxena, K				Barroso, Pedro; Saxena, Konark			Lest We Forget: Learn from Out-of-Sample Forecast Errors When Optimizing Portfolios	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						G11; G12; G17	EMPIRICAL BAYES; CROSS-SECTION; NAIVE DIVERSIFICATION; VARIANCE; RETURNS; ANOMALIES; EQUILIBRIUM; PERFORMANCE; ESTIMATOR; MARKOWITZ	Portfolio optimization often struggles in realistic out-of-sample contexts. We deconstruct this stylized fact by comparing historical forecasts of portfolio optimization inputs with subsequent out-of-sample values. We confirm that historical forecasts are imprecise guides of subsequent values, but we discover the resultant forecast errors are not entirely random. They have predictable patterns and can be partially reduced using their own history. Learning from past forecast errors to calibrate inputs (akin to empirical Bayesian learning) generates portfolio performance that reinforces the case for optimization. Furthermore, the portfolios achieve performance that meets expectations, a desirable yet elusive feature of optimization methods.

J	Ivanyuk, V				Ivanyuk, Vera			Methodology for Constructing an Experimental Investment Strategy Formed in Crisis Conditions	ECONOMIES			English	Article						methodology; investment strategy; risk measure; time series forecasting	PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; EQUILIBRIUM	This article proposes a neoclassical stock market portfolio based on the principles of dynamic response and constant adaptation to the market. The construction of a neoclassical investment portfolio begins with the conceptual development of an adaptive investment strategy. We suggest an algorithm for creating an adaptive investment portfolio. The conceptual model of the investment strategy is presented including the following mandatory components: evaluation, forecasting, investment, and adaptation. This model has the ability to adapt both in normal and in crisis periods of the market. As a description of the forecasting component, an additive mathematical model of the predictive ensemble is used, including seasonal, regression, and shock elements as well as a neural network.

J	Hendawy, E; McMillan, DG; Sakr, ZM; Shahwan, TM				Hendawy, Enas; McMillan, David G.; Sakr, Zaki M.; Shahwan, Tamer Mohamed			Relative informative power and stock return predictability: a new perspective from Egypt	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article; Early Access						Individual stocks; Financial statements; Relative power; Forecasting; Machine learning	GAUSSIAN PROCESS; CROSS-SECTION; PRICES; MODEL; OVERREACTION; PERFORMANCE; VARIABLES; BEHAVIOR; RISK	PurposeThis paper aims to introduce a new perspective on long-term stock return predictability by focusing on the relative (individual and hybrid) informative power of a wide range of accounting (firm-related), technical and macroeconomic factors while considering the past performance of the stocks using machine learning algorithms. Design/methodology/approachThe sample includes a panel data set of 94 non-financial firms listed in Egyptian Exchange 100 index from 2014: Q1 to 2019: Q4. Relativity has been investigated by comparing relevant factors' individual and combined informative power and differentiating between losers and winners based on historical stock returns. To predict the quarterly stock returns, Gaussian process regression (GPR) has been used. The robustness of the results is examined through the out-of-sample test. This study also uses linear regression (LR) as a benchmark model. FindingsThe past performance and the presence of other predictors influence the informative power of relevant factors and hence their predictive ability. The out-of-sample results show a trade-off between GPR and LR with proven superiority to GPR in limited experiments. The individual informative power outperforms the hybrid power, in which macroeconomic indicators outperform the remaining sets of indicators for losers, while winners show mixed results in terms of various performance evaluation metrics. Prediction accuracy is generally higher for losers than for winners. Practical implicationsThis study provides interesting insight into the dynamic nature of the predictor variables in terms of stock return predictability. Hence, this study also deepens the understanding of asset pricing in a way that directly contributes to practitioners' portfolio diversification strategies. Originality/valueIn concern of the chaos of factors in the literature and its accompanying misleading conclusions, this study takes another look at the approach that studies stock return predictability. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in the Egyptian context that re-examines the predictive power of the previously discovered factors from a different perspective that highlights their relative nature.

Learning about risk-factor exposures from earnings: Implications for asset pricing and manipulation*	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING & ECONOMICS			English	Article						Earnings betas; Earnings response coefficients; Asymmetric timeliness; Return predictability; Earnings manipulation; Cost of capital	BUSINESS-CYCLE; MARKET; MANAGEMENT; COST; INFORMATION; DISCLOSURE; MOMENTUM; OFFS	When valuing a firm, investors must assess not only its expected future cash flows but also the systematic risk inherent in these cash flows. In this paper, we model the process by which investors may learn about firms' betas from earnings and how this learning process affects the relationship between earnings, announcement returns, and expected future returns. The model's main predictions are: (i) earnings response coefficients vary with macroeconomic conditions and are lower in upswings than downturns; (ii) earnings positively and negatively predict future returns in economic upswings and downturns, respectively, leading to return autocorrelation; and (iii) real earnings management rises in economic downturns and contributes to systematic risk in the economy. These predictions are directly attributable to investors' uncertainty regarding firms' exposures to systematic risk. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using action research in innovation project management: building legitimacy and organizational learning in an SME during a merger process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Action research; Innovation; Legitimacy; Organizational learning	PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; FRONT-END; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; PERSPECTIVE; PATTERNS	Purpose The purpose is to explore how the process of action research (AR) can support building legitimacy and organizational learning in innovation project management and portfolio practices in merger contexts. Design/methodology/approach Meta-reflection on method issues in Action Research through an action research case study with an innovation group during an organizational change process. This case demonstrates an example of an action research cycle focused on building practitioner legitimacy rather than problem-solving. Findings Key findings include (1) demonstrating how AR can be used for building legitimacy through visualizing the innovation process, and embedding those visuals in top management practices of the organization; and (2) demonstrating how AR can work as an organizational learning tool in merger contexts. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on an action research cooperation during a two-and-a-half-year period. Thus, findings offer the depth of a medium term case study. The processes of building legitimacy represent this particular case, and can be investigated in other organizational contexts to see the extent to which these issues can be generalized. Practical implications For researchers, this paper offers an additional type of AR cycle to consider in their research design which can be seen as demonstrating a form of interplay between practitioner action and organizational level legitimacy. For practitioners, this paper demonstrates a connection between legitimacy and organizational learning in innovation contexts. The discussion of how visuals were co-created and used for building legitimacy for an innovation process that differs from the standard stage gate model demonstrates how engaging in AR research can contribute to developing visuals as resources for building legitimacy and organizational learning based on connections between theory and practice. Originality/value This case rethinks AR practice for innovation project management contexts to include legitimacy and organizational learning. This focus on legitimacy building from organizational learning and knowledge conversion contributes to our understanding of the soft side of innovation project management. Legitimacy is demonstrated to be a key concern for innovation project management practices.

J	Wang, C				Wang, Cong			Stock return prediction with multiple measures using neural network models	FINANCIAL INNOVATION			English	Article						Neural network model; Stock return; Macroeconomic conditions; Factor model; G1; C8	CROSS-SECTION; INVESTOR SENTIMENT	In the field of empirical asset pricing, the challenges of high dimensionality, non-linear relationships, and interaction effects have led to the increasing popularity of machine learning (ML) methods. This study investigates the performance of ML methods when predicting different measures of stock returns from various factor models and investigates the feature importance and interaction effects among firm-specific variables and macroeconomic factors in this context. Our findings reveal that neural network models exhibit consistent performance across different stock return measures when they rely solely on firm-specific characteristic variables. However, the inclusion of macroeconomic factors from the financial market, real economic activities, and investor sentiment leads to substantial improvements in the model performance. Notably, the degree of improvement varies with the specific measures of stock returns under consideration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that, after the inclusion of macroeconomic factors, there is a dissimilarity in model performance, variable importance, and interaction effects among macroeconomic and firm-specific variables, particularly concerning abnormal returns derived from the Fama-French three- and five-factor models compared with excess returns. This divergence is primarily attributed to the extent to which these factor models remove the variance associated with the macroeconomic variables. These findings collectively offer valuable insights into the efficacy of neural network models for stock return predictions and contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between factor models, stock returns, and macroeconomic conditions in the domain of empirical asset pricing.

J	Bauer, D				Bauer, Daniel			Benchmarks for the benchmark approach to valuing long-term insurance liabilities: comment on Fergusson & Platen (2023)	ANNALS OF ACTUARIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Valuation; Derivative pricing; Financial economics; Long-term liabilities	PREMIUM	This article comments on the paper "Less-expensive long-term annuities linked to mortality, cash and equity" by Kevin Fergusson and Eckard Platen, appearing in this issue of the Annals of Actuarial Science. It adds two perspectives to their thought-provoking contribution. The first is a similarity to some recent work in quantitative finance on "deep hedging" that leverages machine learning models to find the cheapest replication strategy for a derivative payoff in a largely model-free setting. The second perspective engages with some of the interesting implications of their approach and draws parallels to literature in asset pricing and macro-finance. These perspectives point to the potential need for more fundamental shifts than the authors of the paper are advertising.

Using more than 10 thousand funding rounds from 2002 to 2020, we found that the status of the firm determines more frequent and larger deals. Non-redundant connections increase the odds of investing, but redundant ones explain larger amounts. Younger firms participate in more deals, but mature firms invest larger amounts. Geographic proximity explains more investments, but institutional differences (regulatory quality and rule of law) explain larger rounds. We show that forecasting models with those features are useful for asset allocation and investment promotion.

We define a market state with recurrent neural network (RNN) volatility predictions and construct an investment strategy that dynamically combines equity, cash, and safe havens. The equity is allocated by targeting the volatility, and investing in safe havens depends on the predicted market state. We consider the S&P500 index with 13 safe haven assets, such as long-term government bonds, commodities, gold, and other precious metals. Other indices, NIKKEI225, NIFTY50, and STOXX50, are examined for robustness. With analysis conducted over a 20-year sample period, we find that RNN delivers sound predictions to construct the volatility targeting strategy. Among considered assets, only long-term Treasury bonds act as a safe haven and improve the strategy performance. Other considered assets have no such potential. Our findings are relevant to portfolio managers and investors actively managing portfolio risk.

J	Zhao, W; Yang, HF; Zhou, H				Zhao, Wei; Yang, Hanfang; Zhou, Hua			Linguistic specificity and stock price synchronicity	CHINA JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						Linguistic Specificity; Market Pricing Efficiency; Textual Analysis; Machine Learning	INFORMATION-CONTENT; REPORT READABILITY; CONCRETENESS; DISCLOSURE; LANGUAGE; IMAGERY; RISK; ACQUISITION; COMPETENCE; SUPPLIERS	Linguistic specificity effectively reduces barriers to information cognition, increasing the efficiency of information acquisition, integration and processing. Combining the psycholinguistics theory of the concreteness effect with asset -pricing theory, we determine that linguistic specificity in the management dis-cussion and analysis section of a firm's annual reports is negatively associated with stock price synchronicity, particularly in firms with strong external infor-mation demand or insufficient information supply. Furthermore, only speci-ficity of the review section leads to a reduction in stock price synchronicity. Mechanism tests show that specificity reduces information processing costs and enhances information credibility. Additionally, proprietary costs are an essential determinant of linguistic specificity adoption. Our findings suggest that linguistic specificity plays an essential role in improving market pricing efficiency.(c) 2021 Sun Yat-sen University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

J	Bucci, A; Ciciretti, V				Bucci, Andrea; Ciciretti, Vito			Market regime detection via realized covariances	ECONOMIC MODELLING			English	Article						Regime detection; Hierarchical clustering; Realized volatility; Nonlinear models	ECONOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; MODEL	Identifying market regimes is crucial for asset pricing and portfolio management. Within efficient markets, the macroeconomic conditions drive the demand for risky assets. Consequently, the transitions between different regimes are reflected into covariance matrices, whose time-varying coefficients react to unexpected news. Accordingly, we identify market regimes by feeding latent information embedded in the covariances to various regime-switching models and an unsupervised learning methodology. The advantage over existing methods is that our approach considers all information in the covariances to detect regimes while allowing for smooth and abrupt regime changes. We display each model's ability to correctly detect regimes through a simulation study and by evaluating a regime-switching investment strategy. Our results point to hierarchical clustering as the best-performing model for labelling market regimes with both simulated and observed data. Furthermore, we find that regime-switching models based on an observable transition variable perform well during overall periods of stress.

J	Stentoft, L; Wang, S				Stentoft, Lars; Wang, Sha			Consistent and Efficient Dynamic Portfolio Replication with Many Factors	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SHRINKAGE	Factor investing involves choosing securities to construct portfolios with particular risk-return profiles. With the proliferation of benchmark-tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) virtually any risk-return profile can be reconstructed; the challenge is to find the right ETFs because the number of relevant ETFs is very large. This article proposes an innovative modification to the resampling procedure used in many popular machine learning methods for reducing the dimensionality of this problem. The proposed method allows selection of the specific ETFs used to replicate returns, taking the total costs of using the optimal portfolio to dynamically track returns into consideration. Existing variable selection algorithms are not designed to incorporate rebalancing costs, which are accumulated over time. The methodology is illustrated by replicating hedge fund returns with ETFs. The results show that, by selecting the right replication instruments in a way that is consistent with an investor's economic utility instead of using purely statistical losses, the investor can save around 60 bps per year.

J	Hermano, V; Martin-Cruz, N; Pajares, J				Hermano, Victor; Martin-Cruz, Natalia; Pajares, Javier			The effect of project management dynamic capabilities on firm performance	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Program management; Portfolio management; Project-based learning; Organizational performance; Operational capabilities	PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; MODEL; NONRESPONSE; INVOLVEMENT; MODERATOR; VARIANCE; IMPACT; BIAS	Purpose The purpose of the paper is to shed light on the output of project management (PM) dynamic capabilities Specifically, the study investigates what effect PM dynamic capabilities have on company performance, both directly and indirectly, through the mediation effect of project and portfolio performance. Additionally, it tests whether program performance might also mediate the relationship. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses were tested using partial least squares with a sample of 63 international firms that engage in projects globally. Findings The main finding of this research is that PM dynamic capabilities do not influence firm performance directly but do so indirectly by increasing firms' performance in projects, programs and portfolios. Both project and portfolio performance have a mediation effect on the relationship between dynamic capabilities and firm performance, but portfolio performance absorbs all this effect when the two performances are in the model. Originality/value This paper sheds light on the link between dynamic capabilities and firm performance. It tests the real outcome of dynamic capabilities by making an explicit distinction between firm performance at three intermediate levels (project, program and portfolio) and overall firm performance. Moreover, it opens the black box of dynamic capabilities and empirically operationalizes the theoretical model of sensing-seizing-transforming as the three constituting routines of dynamic capabilities.

J	Bichuch, M; Guasoni, P				Bichuch, Maxim; Guasoni, Paolo			The learning premium	MATHEMATICS AND FINANCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Equilibrium; Asset pricing; Filtering; Learning; G11; G12	INFORMATION QUALITY; EQUITY PREMIUM; STOCK RETURNS; ASSET PRICES; RISK; CONSUMPTION	We find equilibrium stock prices and interest rates in a representative-agent model where dividend growth is uncertain, but gradually revealed by dividends themselves, while asset prices reflect current information and the potential impact of future knowledge. In addition to the usual premium for risk, stock returns include a learning premium, which reflects the expected change in prices from new information. In the long run, the learning premium vanishes, as prices and interest rates converge to their counterparts in the standard setting with known dividend growth. If both relative risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution are above one, the model reproduces the increase in price-dividend ratios observed in the past century, and implies that-in the long run-price-dividend ratios may increase a further forty percent above current levels.

J	Ono, S				Ono, Sadayuki			Term structure dynamics in a monetary economy with learning	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Term structure of interest rates; Monetary asset-pricing model; Uncertainty in parameters; Learning	INTEREST-RATES; INFLATION RISK; EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS; VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION; HETEROGENEOUS BELIEFS; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; ASSET PRICES; MONEY GROWTH; REGIME; POLICY	This paper investigates a continuous-time monetary asset-pricing model of the term structure of nominal interest rates. In a pure exchange economy with incomplete information, investors cannot observe the expected growth rates of both exogenous real output and money supply. Therefore, they apply dynamic Bayesian inference. The model obtains explicit solutions for equilibrium prices of consumption goods and nominal bonds, and the stochastic process of an investor's beliefs. The dependence of term premia on beliefs allows the model to introduce a GARCH property, which interacts with the volatility of the macro variables. In particular, the volatility of excess returns is inversely related to noise in the macro variables, suggesting that their imprecise information does not increase fluctuations in interest rates. Using beliefs as the factor of uncertainties in economic states, the model also shows that there is a negative correlation between the new measure of uncertainty and the velocity of money, consistent with Friedman's explanation that demand for money for precautionary motives has a negative impact on the velocity.

Data was collected on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HOSE) from 2010 to 2022 by month, with 145 observations. Firstly, the study compared the two theoretical models, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and FF3, and investigated that FF3 explains volatili-ty in portfolio returns better than CAPM. Furthermore, to forecast the return rate, the study applied Ordinary Least Square (OLS) for CAPM and FF3 and SVR methods for CAPM and FF3. This research used the roll window method to train-test the model and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's accuracy. An F test was used to compare the performance of these four models. As a result, the FF3 model uses the SVR algorithm more efficiently than the OLS and CAPM.

J	Geng, GJ; Guan, ZG				Geng, Guojing; Guan, Zhigui			RETRACTED: Application of Capital Asset Pricing Model Based on BP Neural Network in E-commerce Financing (Retracted Article)	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Retracted Publication							INNOVATION	The study explores the risks and benefits of investors in e-commerce financing under the background of "double carbon" to maximize investors' interests and reduce investment losses. The Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm model of e-commerce enterprise financing based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is mainly studied. First, according to the worldwide literature, the theoretical concept and principle of the CAPM are deeply studied and analyzed. Then, from the perspective of "double carbon," with the financing risk characteristics of listed companies responding to the "double carbon" policy as samples, the CAPM model of e-commerce financing under the BPNN algorithm is established. Next, the BPNN is used to input the financing samples of e-commerce enterprises and train the model. The verification experiment of the capital asset financing model of e-commerce enterprises is further conducted. The experimental results show that the model error is the smallest when the number of neurons in the hidden layer reaches about 20. Therefore, the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the model is set to 20. When the number of iterations in training reaches 3000, the financing risk model begins to show a convergence trend. Finally, it can be determined that the number of adaptive iterations of the model is 3000. When the learning rate is 0.03, the oscillation of the model is smaller and stabler, so the model learning rate is 0.03, and the final model error is only 9.96 x 10(-8). Based on this, e-commerce enterprises can achieve the purpose using this model to adjust the coefficient in financing in the future. The results have certain reference significance for e-commerce financing risk assessment under a "double carbon" background.

JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE			English	Article						Capital reallocation; Textual analysis; Machine learning; Diffusion index model	HOME BIAS; TEXTUAL ANALYSIS; ALLOCATION; INVESTMENT	This paper delves into the impact of FOMC policy announcements and meeting minutes on the reallocation of US assets at the fund level. We address the challenge of uncertain reallocation scenarios through employing a data imputation technique with random forest forecasts and fund level features. We then quantify the most predictive information from FOMC policy statements and meeting minutes through constructed diffusion indices using a supervised learning approach. By conducting predictive fixed-effect regression analyses, we unveil the significant role of incorporating textual predictors derived from FOMC statements. Our findings reveal that positive and negative signals in FOMC announcements have contrasting effects on changes in US asset allocation. Additional exercises demonstrate that net assets and reallocation channels matter for the responses of funds to FOMC statements. We also find substantial evidence of the increased attention paid to FOMC announcements after the 2008 crisis. This heightened attention notably impacts funds that adjust US holdings using their own capital. Furthermore, we examine the presence of home bias among US and non-OECD funds in comparison to other OECD-based funds. Our analysis suggests the potential presence of a home bias among US and non-OECD funds.

Growing, learning, and connecting: Deciphering the complex relationship between government customer concentration and firm performance	JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT			English	Article						absorptive capacity; customer base; customer portfolio management; government customer concentration; network embeddedness	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; STRUCTURAL EMBEDDEDNESS; BASE CONCENTRATION; SUPPLY CHAINS; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; DEPENDENCE; CONTRACT; RISKS	The interplay between a firm's customer portfolio and the firm's performance presents a theoretical conundrum that challenges traditional supply chains. In particular, the role of government customer concentration-how extensively a firm incorporates government entities as part of its customer base-emerges as a pivotal factor with the potential to both bolster and burden firm performance. Analyzing 3,643 firm-year observations from the U.S. Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation, Compustat, and FactSet Revere reveals an inverse U-shaped relationship between government customer concentration and firm performance. Excessive or insufficient government customer concentration adversely impacts performance, suggesting that a strategic balance is essential. Firm size, absorptive capacity, and network embeddedness are crucial in navigating this complex relationship, guiding a firm toward optimizing its government customer portfolio. This research advances the discourse on customer base management, underscoring the essential strategic considerations for firms interacting with government buyers.

J	Srivastava, PR; Zhang, ZP; Eachempati, P				Srivastava, Praveen Ranjan; Zhang, Zuopeng (Justin); Eachempati, Prajwal			Deep Neural Network and Time Series Approach for Finance Systems: Predicting the Movement of the Indian Stock Market	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND END USER COMPUTING			English	Article						Deep Neural Network; Gradient Boosting; NSE; Random Forest; Stock Market; Time-Series Prediction	CLASSIFIER	The stock market is an aggregation of investor sentiment that affects daily changes in stock prices. Investor sentiment remained a mystery and challenge over time, inviting researchers to comprehend the market trends. The entry of behavioral scientists in and around the 1980s brought in the market trading's human dimensions. Shortly after that, due to the digitization of exchanges, the mix of traders changed as institutional traders started using algorithmic trading (AT) on computers. Nevertheless, the effects of investor sentiment did not disappear and continued to intrigue market researchers. Though market sentiment plays a significant role in timing investment decisions, classical finance models largely ignored the role of investor sentiment in asset pricing. For knowing if the market price is value-driven, the investor would isolate components of irrationality from the price, as reflected in the sentiment. Investor sentiment is an expression of irrational expectations of a stock's risk-return profile that is not justified by available information. In this context, the paper aims to predict the next- day trend in the index prices for the centralized Indian National Stock Exchange (NSE) deploying machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks. The training set is historical NSE closing price data from June 1st, 2013-June 30th, 2020. Additionally, the authors factor technical indicators like moving average (MA), moving average convergence-divergence (MACD), K (%) oscillator and corresponding three days moving average D (%), relative strength indicator (RSI) value, and the LW (R%) indicator for the same period. The predictive power of deep neural networks over other machine learning techniques is established in the paper, demonstrating the future scope of deep learning in multi-parameter time series prediction.

In contrast to the traditional approaches, the machine is able to learn risk measures, preferences, and constraints beyond simple expected returns, within a flexible, forward-looking, and non-linear framework. Our empirical analysis illustrates that predicting the optimal weights directly instead of the traditional two-step approach leads to more stable portfolios with statistically better risk-adjusted performance measures.

The experts were asked about their approaches to factor investing, the characteristics they look for in a factor, and which factors they believed in and why. The webinar covered topics such as the viability of value as a factor over the past decade, the role of ESG as a factor, and the possibility of discovering new factors. The difference between factors and signals was discussed, along with the potential for factor timing. The panelists also examined how to incorporate factors into portfolios, identified the biggest challenges facing factor investing, and shared the main findings from research on factor portfolio construction. They also discussed the most promising areas of research in the field, including Machine Learning and the application of factors to private markets. Additionally, the discrepancy between the use of factors in equities versus fixed income was discussed. Overall, the webinar provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities associated with factor investing.

J	Kaczmarek, T; Grobelny, P				Kaczmarek, Tomasz; Grobelny, Przemyslaw			How to fly to safety without overpaying for the ticket	ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article						asset allocation strategy; target volatility; flight-to-safety; recurrent neural networks; machine learning	FLIGHT-TO-SAFETY; VOLATILITY MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; INDEX; STRATEGY; PREMIUM; RETURN; STOCKS	For most active investors treasury bonds (govs) provide diversification and thus reduce the risk of a portfolio. These features of govs become particularly desirable in times of elevated risk which materialize in the form of the flight-to-safety (FTS) phenomenon. The FTS for govs provides a shelter during market turbulence and is exceptionally beneficial for portfolio drawdown risk reduction. However, what if the unsatisfactory expected return from treasuries discourages higher bonds allocations? This research proposes a solution to this problem with Deep Target Volatility Equity-Bond Allocation (DTVEBA) that dynamically allocate portfolios between equity and treasuries. The strategy is driven by a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) that predicts next-day market volatility. An analysis conducted over a twelve year out-of-sample period found that with DTVEBA an investor may reduce treasury allocation by two (three) times to get the same Sharpe (Calmar) ratio and overper-forms the S & P500 index by 43% (115%).

J	Liu, HT; Zou, J; Ravishanker, N				Liu, Haitao; Zou, Jian; Ravishanker, Nalini			Clustering high-frequency financial time series based on information theory	APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY			English	Article						clustering; high-frequency; mutual information; time series	RISK	Clustering large financial time series data enables pattern extraction that facilitates risk management. The knowledge gathered from unsupervised learning is useful for improving portfolio optimization and making stock trading recommendations. Most methods available in the literature for clustering financial time series are based on exploiting linear relationships between time series. However, prices of different assets (stocks) may have non-linear relationships which may be quantified using information based measures such as mutual information (MI). To estimate the empirical mutual information between time series of stock returns, we employ a novel kernel density estimator (KDE) based jackknife mutual information estimation (JMI), and compare it with the widely-used binning method. We then propose an average distance gradient change algorithm and an algorithm based on the average silhouette criterion that use pairwise and groupwise MI of high-frequency financial stock returns. Through numerical studies, we provide insights into the impact of the clustering on asset allocation and risk management based on the nonlinear information structure of the US stock market.

J	Teng, MM; Tan, WJ				Teng, Mingming; Tan, Weijie			ESG ratings and corporate competitive strategy: evidence from China	APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						ESG ratings; corporate competitive strategy; financing assets allocation; bank agglomeration; L10; M14		This paper investigates the impact of ESG ratings on the competitive strategies of Chinese listed companies. Machine learning and text analysis methods are used to develop indicators for cost leadership and differentiation strategies. A time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) model is employed to quantitatively assess the impact of ESG ratings on these strategies. The findings show that ESG ratings positively affect both strategies. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that companies with lower bank concentration or insufficient financial asset allocation benefit more significantly from ESG ratings in enhancing their competitive strategies. This research provides theoretical insights and practical recommendations for the integration of ESG factors into corporate strategy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

That is, the agents do not question whether the economy is growing or not, but instead continuously estimate how long economic cycles will last-i.e., they learn about the persistence of fundamentals. Learning about persistence generates high and persistent stock return volatility mostly during recessions, but also (to a smaller extent) during economic booms. Disagreement among agents fluctuates and earns a risk premium. A clear risk-return trade-off appears only when conditioning on the sign and magnitude of disagreement. We confirm these predictions empirically.

J	Yin, T; Wang, YM				Yin, Tao; Wang, Yiming			Market Efficiency and Nonlinear Analysis of Soybean Futures	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						inefficiency; nonlinearity; soybean; MF-DFA; futures		In this paper, the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method is used to identify the multifractal structure of in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean futures and quantitatively describe the inefficiency and nonlinearity of the market. The data is the daily price of CBOT soybean futures from 3 January 2000 to 20 December 2019, with a total of 5025 trading days. The empirical results also show that the perspective based on MF-DFA can explain the market's nonlinear, long-range correlation, predictability and other financial anomalies. At the same time, the prediction of price change direction and risk degree of the market are further studied. It is pointed out that multifractal characteristics are generated under the joint action of fat-tail distribution and long-range correlation. Investors can make use of these market characteristics to make arbitrage possible. Finally, based on the empirical results, some policy suggestions are put forward: strengthening rational investment education, strengthening supervision, reducing information asymmetry and other measures to improve market efficiency.

J	Freire, G				Freire, Gustavo			Tail risk and investors' concerns: Evidence from Brazil	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Tail risk; Risk-neutral measure; Return predictability; Machine learning; Text-based analysis	RARE DISASTERS; MEDIA	I estimate tail risk for Brazil from January 2001 to July 2020 and investigate the origins of tail risk variation. The tail risk measure peaks at stock market crashes, financial crises, political shocks and disaster events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, I find that tail risk is countercyclical, has strong predictive power for market returns and negatively predicts real economic activity. In order to identify the investors' concerns associated with tail risk, I extract daily news from the largest financial newspaper in Brazil. The co-movement between news and tail risk indicates that tail risk variation is mainly driven by disaster concerns, followed by economic and government uncertainty. While economic uncertainty explains the countercyclical property of tail risk, investors only require compensation for bearing tail risk implied by disaster concerns. Similarly, tail risk negatively impacts real outcomes because of the disaster concerns that it identifies. These findings support recent models explaining asset pricing puzzles with time-varying disaster risk.

Option Pricing Models: From Black-Scholes-Merton to Present	JOURNAL OF DERIVATIVES			English	Article							HEDGING DERIVATIVE SECURITIES; FOREIGN-CURRENCY OPTIONS; EARLY-EXERCISE OPTIONS; STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; ANALYTIC APPROXIMATION; AMERICAN OPTIONS; INTEREST-RATES; TERM STRUCTURE; CONTINGENT CLAIMS; VALUATION	Its intuitiveness and the simplicity of its calculations make the seminal Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model the most commonly known and used among all asset pricing models ever developed. Almost half a century after it was introduced, a massive literature has been devoted, and is still being generated, to empirical testing of the original model, to developing new models addressing its original assumptions and biases, and to extending the framework of option pricing. This article presents a review of fundamental option pricing models from Black-Scholes-Merton to the present day, covering alternative option pricing approaches, including those for options on different underlying assets as well as those with different asset price and volatility dynamics. This article also reviews contemporary topics in options, including applications to novel risks such as climate-related risks and volatility risk, as well as implementation of novel methodologies from data science and machine learning.

J	Sinon, MB; Mba, JC				Sinon, Mohavia Ben Amid; Mba, Jules Clement			The analysis of diversification properties of stablecoins through the Shannon entropy measure	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Entropy; Stablecoins; Diversification; Mean-absolute deviation (MAD); Mean-absolute deviation-entropy (MAD-entropy); Mean Variance (MV); Risk; Return	SAFE HAVEN; PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; BITCOIN; HEDGE; MODEL; SELECTION; GOLD	The common goal for investors is to minimise the risk and maximise the returns on their investments. This is often achieved through diversification, where investors spread their investments across various assets. This study aims to use the MAD-entropy model to minimise the absolute deviation, maximise the mean return, and maximise the Shannon entropy of the portfolio. The MAD model is used because it is a linear programming model, allowing it to resolve large-scale problems and nonnormally distributed data. Entropy is added to the MAD model because it can better diversify the weight of assets in the portfolios. The analysed portfolios consist of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and selected world indices such as the SP500 and FTSE obtained from Yahoo Finance. The models found that stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, followed by stablecoins pegged to gold, are better diversifiers for traditional cryptocurrencies and stocks. These results are probably due to their low volatility compared to the other assets. Findings from this study may assist investors since the MAD-Entropy model outperforms the MAD model by providing more significant portfolio mean returns with minimal risk. Therefore, crypto investors can design a well-diversified portfolio using MAD entropy to reduce unsystematic risk. Further research integrating mad entropy with machine learning techniques may improve accuracy and risk management.

J	Plakandaras, V; Ji, Q				Plakandaras, Vasilios; Ji, Qiang			Intrinsic decompositions in gold forecasting	JOURNAL OF COMMODITY MARKETS			English	Article						Machine learning; Support vector regression; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition		A quasi-stylized fact in the literature is that gold is a safe haven for investors when there is turbulence in the financial markets. Although investing in gold is not new, the relevant literature fails to reach a consensus regarding the forces that drive gold prices or a universally accepted forecasting model that can be used in the evaluation of asset allocation in gold portfolios. In this paper, we depart from the typical econometric approaches in the field and re-evaluate gold forecasting using a hybrid method. The proposed model is based on short- and long-run decomposition of input variables using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm and forecasting each component separately based on the Support Vector Regression method. Compared to previous methods in the field, our empirical findings suggest that the proposed method significantly increases the economic returns of a trading strategy based on the forecasts of the proposed scheme.

J	Jin, ZB				Jin, Zuben			Business aspects in focus, investor underreaction and return predictability	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE			English	Article						Business aspects; Earnings conferenece cella; Topic modelling; Informaiton diffusion; Cross-asset momentum	CROSS-SECTION; CONFERENCE CALLS; TEXTUAL ANALYSIS; DISCLOSURE; SENTIMENT; ARBITRAGE; READABILITY; MANAGERIAL; INDUSTRIES; VOLATILITY	Overlap in business aspects serves as a proxy for firm relatedness. Employing an unsupervised topic modelling methodology from machine learning, we characterize the attention allocations of earnings conference call participants (corporate executives, financial analysts, and investors) over the topics discussed. We construct a novel topic similarity measure that captures incremental, difficult-to-observe, and time-varying firm relatedness. However, valuable information from topic peers is not incorporated into stock price in a timely fashion. A long-short strategy based on the returns of topic peers yields a monthly alpha of approximately 69 basis points. Furthermore, return predictability stems primarily from similar business models, customer management, and influential macroeconomic situations. Return predictability is more pronounced among focal firms with higher information complexities and arbitrage costs. Overall, this study provides a novel approach to automatically summarise firms' business aspects in focus and highlights the asset pricing implications of investors' underreactions to non-obvious and dynamic firm relatedness hidden in earnings conference calls.

J	Su, ZF; Bao, HH; Li, QF; Xu, BY; Cui, X				Su, Zhifang; Bao, Haohua; Li, Qifang; Xu, Boyu; Cui, Xin			The prediction of price gap anomaly in Chinese stock market: Evidence from the dependent functional logit model	FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Dependent functional logit model; Price gap anomaly; The truncation-free Bartlett kernel	JUMPS	How to accurately predict the price gap anomaly is important for asset pricing and risk management. This paper considers the dependence features of high-frequency data and proposes a new dependent functional logit model to predict price gap anomaly, which is an extension of the traditional functional logit model (Escabias et al., 2004). Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our model is significantly superior in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy compared with the model that constructed by the FPC estimation and NW estimation. Combining the current day's 5-minute closing price data of the Shanghai Securities Composite Index (SSEC) from Jan 2, 2019 to Dec 31, 2019, we employ this model to predict the next day's price gap anomaly. After comparing with traditional machine learning algorithms, the empirical results find that the prediction effect of our model is better than that of the RBF kernel SVM model and the GBDT model.

J	Goldberg, LR; Mouti, S				Goldberg, Lisa R.; Mouti, Saad			Sustainable investing and the cross-section of returns and maximum drawdown	JOURNAL OF FINANCE AND DATA SCIENCE			English	Article						Maximum Drawdown; Asset Pricing; Machine learning; Linear Regression; Random Forest; Neural Networks; Penalized Regression; Reduction Methods; Sustainable Investing	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; RISK; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; EQUILIBRIUM; INVESTMENTS; VALUATION; MARKET	We use supervised learning to identify factors that predict the cross-section of returns and maximum drawdown for stocks in the US equity market. Our data run from January 1970 to December 2019 and our analysis includes ordinary least squares, penalized linear regressions, tree-based models, and neural networks. We find that the most important predictors tended to be consistent across models, and that non-linear models had better predictive power than linear models. Predictive power was higher in calm periods than in stressed periods. Environmental, social, and governance indicators marginally impacted the predictive power of non-linear models in our data, despite their negative correlation with maximum drawdown and positive correlation with returns. Upon exploring whether ESG variables are captured by some models, we find that ESG data contribute to the prediction nonetheless. (c) 2022 The Authors.

J	Evans, GW; Hommes, C; McGough, B; Salle, I				Evans, George W.; Hommes, Cars; McGough, Bruce; Salle, Isabelle			Are long-horizon expectations (de-)stabilizing? Theory and experiments	JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Learning; Long-horizon expectations; Asset pricing; Experiments	MARKET VOLATILITY; BUBBLES; STABILITY; CRASHES; PRICES; LUCAS; RISK	The impact of finite forecasting horizons on price dynamics is examined in a standard infinite-horizon asset-pricing model. Our theoretical results link forecasting horizon inversely to expectational feedback , and predict a positive relationship between expectational feedback and various measures of asset-price volatility. We design a laboratory experiment to test these predictions. Consistent with our theory, short-horizon markets are prone to substantial and prolonged deviations from rational expectations, whereas markets with even a modest share of long-horizon forecasters exhibit convergence. Longer-horizon forecasts display more heterogeneity but also prevent coordination on incorrect anchors - a pattern that leads to mispricing in short-horizon markets.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						artificial neural networks; forecasting; Fama and French 5 Factors CAPM; asset pricing models; stock markets	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; STOCK SELECTION; PREDICTION; RETURNS; RISK	Forecasting the stock returns in the emerging markets is challenging due to their peculiar characteristics. These markets exhibit linear as well as nonlinear features and Conventional forecasting methods partially succeed in dealing with the nonlinear nature of stock returns. Contrarily, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a flexible machine learning tool which caters both the linear and nonlinear markets. This paper investigates the forecasting ability of ANN by using Fama and French five-factor model. We construct ANN'S based on the composite factors of the FF5F model to predict portfolio returns in two stages; in stage one, the study identifies the best-fit combination of training, testing, and validation along with the number of neurons full sample period. In stage two, the study uses this best combination to forecast the model under 48-months rolling window analysis. In-sample and out-sample comparisons, regression, and goodness of fit test and actual and predicted values of the stock returns of our ANN model reveal that the proposed model accurately predicts the one-month ahead returns. Our findings reinforce the investment concept that the markets compensate the high-risk portfolios more than mid and low beta portfolios and the methodology will significantly improve the return on investment of the investors.

J	Zhang, XT; Zhang, WG				Zhang, Xuetong; Zhang, Weiguo			Information asymmetry, sentiment interactions, and asset price	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Investor sentiment; Information asymmetry; Asset pricing; Institutional investor; Individual investor	INVESTOR SENTIMENT; CROSS-SECTION; MARKET; DISCLOSURE; MEDIA; RISK; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL; MONEY	We develop an asset pricing model with sentiment interactions between institutional and individual investors under the condition of information asymmetry. Our model considers private information and investor sentiment, two imperfections in securities markets, and integrates them into a theoretical model to investigate the role of the interaction between information asymmetry and investor sentiment in asset pricing. We show that the joint effect of private information and investor sentiment deviate the price of risky assets and efficiently explains anomalies in the stock market. Investor sentiment changes the effect of information on the equilibrium price relative to a world where all investors are completely rational. Private information changes the effect of investor sentiment on the equilibrium price in comparison with a scenario with symmetric market information. In addition, the individual investors' learning and the disclosure of information both allow private information to be better integrated into the price and simultaneously changes the effect of investor sentiment on the equilibrium price.

J	Foltice, B; Rogers, R				Foltice, Bryan; Rogers, Rachel			Ambiguity aversion and experiential learning: implications for long-term savings decisions	REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE			English	Article						Ambiguity aversion; Stock market participation; Experiential learning; Retirement planning	LIMITED MARKET PARTICIPATION; FINANCIAL LITERACY; RISK	Purpose This paper evaluates potential methods for reducing ambiguity surrounding returns on equity to improve long-term savings decisions. Design/methodology/approach We evaluate 221 undergraduate students in the US and first assess the degree of ambiguity aversion exhibited by individuals in the sample population as they decide between a risky (known probability) option and ambiguous (unknown probability) option pertaining to their chances of winning $0 or $1 in a hypothetical lottery. Similarly, we test whether sampling historical return data through learning modules influences long-term decision making regarding asset allocation within a retirement portfolio. Findings Allowing participants to experience the underlying probability through sampling significantly influences behavior, as participants were more likely to select the ambiguous option after sampling. Here, we also find that participants who receive interactive learning modules - which require users to manually alter the asset allocation to produce a sample of historical return data based on the specific allocation entered in the model - increase their post-learning equity allocations by 10.1% more than individuals receiving static modules. Interestingly, we find no significant evidence of ambiguity aversion playing a role in the asset allocation decision. Originality/value We find that decision-making related to ambiguous and risky options can be substantially influenced by experiential learning. Our study supplements previous literature, providing a link between research on the effect of ambiguity on stock market participation and implementation of educational programs to improve the asset allocation decision for young adults.

Wall street watches Washington: Asset pricing implications of policy uncertainty	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE			English	Article						Analyst forecasts; Earnings announcements; Economic policy uncertainty; Limited attention	EARNINGS-ANNOUNCEMENT DRIFT; INVESTOR ATTENTION; POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY; ANALYSTS FORECASTS; MACROECONOMIC NEWS; CROSS-SECTION; OF-INTEREST; INFORMATION; UNDERREACTION; MANAGEMENT	We examine the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on sell-side analysts' forecasts, the allocation of attention, and the stock market reaction to earnings news. We find that periods of high EPU are associated with higher analyst disagreement and a decrease in forecast accuracy. Specifically, we show that analysts issue on average more pessimistic forecasts when EPU is high. Second, we show that higher levels of EPU are associated with higher attention to the overall stock market and lower firm-level attention, in line with category learning behavior. Forecast errors also have a larger firm-specific component during periods of high EPU. Finally, we show that the trading volume and price responses to earnings announcements hardly depend on EPU. Hence, investors tend to follow analyst forecasts, thereby failing to incorporate a predictable bias.

J	Moreira, AM; Martins, LF				Moreira, Afonso M.; Martins, Luis F.			A new mechanism for anticipating price exuberance	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE			English	Article						Speculative bubbles; Asset pricing; Non-stationarity; Adaptive learning; Dynamic models	SPECULATIVE BUBBLES; RATIONAL BUBBLES; ECONOMETRIC TESTS; ASSET PRICES; MARKETS; CRASHES; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM; NASDAQ; RISK	It is very important for investors, market regulators, and policy makers to possess a trustworthy exante tool capable of anticipating price exuberance events. This paper proposes a new statistical mechanism to predict speculative bubbles by inferring a significant probability of exuberance at least one step ahead of a bubble peak period. Contrary to other approaches, we combine asset pricing modeling and non-stationarity statistical analysis and use both in the context of adaptive learning to build a dynamic model specification. Monte Carlo simulations show that the ex-ante prediction is improved enormously by adding the estimated abnormal returns into the model. In some cases our mechanism predicts 100% of the last bubbles of the sample up to five periods before the peak. Furthermore, the mechanism is able to successfully anticipate the technological bubble observed in the 1990's by estimating a probability greater than 90%, one month before the bubble peak. Thus, this new mechanism provides an advantage for investors interested in performing a very profitable "bubble surfing" strategy and for market regulators whose responsibility is to maintain market efficiency.

J	Li, JF				Li, Jinfang			The sentiment pricing dynamics with short-term and long-term learning	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Sentiment investors; Behavioral asset pricing; Learning; Market efficiency	INVESTOR SENTIMENT; CROSS-SECTION; MARKET; RETURN; VOLATILITY; MODEL; RISK; INFORMATION	Combining the behavioral characteristics of rational uninformed investors with learning infor-mation behavior of sentiment investors, this paper establishes a mathematical model about the impact of learning information behavior on the investor's transaction and asset equilibrium price under asymmetric information. Research shows that when rational uninformed investors learn information in the short term, on the one hand, they choose to bet against sentiment investors, thus reducing the influence of sentiment; on the other hand, they occasionally mistake sentiment for information to chase sentiment investors, then amplifying sentiment shocks. Furthermore, sentiment investors can also gain valuable information indirectly by observing the price in the long term. When sentiment investors learn information in the long term, the price fluctuations caused by sentiment and information, informativeness of the price system and market efficiency are no longer dependent on the quality of information.

We focus on three specific EMV trackers, namely, overall EMV (OEMV), commodity EMV (CEMV), and petroleum EMV (PEMV). We find that all the EMV trackers can improve the forecasting performance of crude oil market volatility. CEMV is better than OEMV, and PEMV is the best. Furthermore, the PEMV tracker can beat many other popular uncertainty predictors. The predictive ability of the PEMV tracker is consistent in a variety of robustness checks and extensions. We demonstrate that the predictability of PEMV stems from not only the volatility index (VIX), which is well-recognized for forecasting crude oil market volatility, but also the valuable information related to petroleum. In addition, the machine learning evidence suggests that PEMV is more useful than OEMV, CEMV, and other category-specific EMV trackers. Finally, the PEMV tracker can help mean-variance investors realize the largest economic gain in an asset allocation application.

J	Zhang, Y; Li, Z; Zhang, YC				Zhang, Yi; Li, Zhe; Zhang, Yongchao			Validation and Calibration of an Agent-Based Model: A Surrogate Approach	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							DYNAMICS	Agent-based modelling has been proved to be extremely useful for learning about real world societies through the analysis of simulations. Recent agent-based models usually contain a large number of parameters that capture the interactions among microheterogeneous subjects and the multistructure of the complex system. However, this can result in the "curse of dimensionality" phenomenon and decrease the robustness of the model's output. Hence, it is still a great challenge to efficiently calibrate agent-based models to actual data. In this paper, we present a surrogate analysis method for calibration by combining supervised machine-learning and intelligent iterative sampling. Without any prior assumptions regarding the distribution of the parameter space, the proposed method can learn a surrogate model as the approximation of the original system with a relatively small number of training points, which will serve the needs of further sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration research. We take the heterogeneous asset pricing model as an example to evaluate the model's performance using actual Chinese stock market data. The results demonstrate the good capabilities of the surrogate model at modelling the observed reality, as well as the remarkable reduction of the computational time for validating the agent-based model.

J	Dhara, A; Das, B; Natarajan, K				Dhara, Anulekha; Das, Bikramjit; Natarajan, Karthik			Worst-Case Expected Shortfall with Univariate and Bivariate Marginals	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						distributionally robust optimization; bivariate marginals; tree	VALUE-AT-RISK; PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; ROBUST; COMPLEXITY; BOUNDS; VINES	Computing and minimizing the worst-case bound on the expected shortfall risk of a portfolio given partial information on the distribution of the asset returns is an important problem in risk management. One such bound that been proposed is for the worst-case distribution that is "close" to a reference distribution where closeness in distance among distributions is measured using phi-divergence. In this paper, we advocate the use of such ambiguity sets with a tree structure on the univariate and bivariate marginal distributions. Such an approach has attractive modeling and computational properties. From a modeling perspective, this provides flexibility for risk management applications where there are many more choices for bivariate copulas in comparison with multivariate copulas. Bivariate copulas form the basis of the nested tree structure that is found in vine copulas. Because estimating a vine copula is fairly challenging, our approach provides robust bounds that are valid for the tree structure that is obtained by truncating the vine copula at the top level. The model also provides flexibility in tackling instances when the lower dimensional marginal information is inconsistent that might arise when multiple experts provide information. From a computational perspective, under the assumption of a tree structure on the bivariate marginals, we show that the worst-case expected shortfall is computable in polynomial time in the input size when the distributions are discrete. The corresponding distributionally robust portfolio optimization problem is also solvable in polynomial time. In contrast, under the assumption of independence, the expected shortfall is shown to be #P-hard to compute for discrete distributions. We provide numerical examples with simulated and real data to illustrate the quality of the worst-case bounds in risk management and portfolio optimization and compare it with alternate probabilistic models such as vine copulas and Markov tree distributions.

J	Xu, FM; Ma, JA; Lu, HB				Xu, Fengmin; Ma, Jieao; Lu, Haibing			Group sparse enhanced indexation model with adaptive beta value	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE			English	Article						Enhanced indexation; Group sparse; Beta value; Data-driven learning	PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; SELECTION; TRACKING; MARKET; PERFORMANCE; SERIES	Enhanced indexing, which has been used by professional portfolio managers for decades, is a portfolio management strategy that attempts to increase returns by building a portfolio around core, index-like positions and adding tactical tilts toward specific styles or individual stocks. This paper proposes an improved enhanced indexation model by considering the systematic risk, measured by Beta value, and the industry rotation phenomenon. The systematic risk is the risk related to the stock market as a whole and can be reasonably controlled to improve portfolio performance, by actively tracking and forecasting the market trend. Sector rotation refers to the investment strategy of taking money that's invested in one stock market industry and moving it to another, by taking advantage of the historical performances of specific industries during different phases of the cycle. In specific, our model aims to find a small set of industries that is mostly likely to thrive in the anticipated future, which is mathematically realized by dividing stocks into industries and minimizing their L-2,L-1 norm. To evaluate our strategy, we conducted extensive numerical experiments against some major world indices, e.g. CSI 300, S&P 500, FTSE 100 and Nikkei 225. The experimental result shows that our approach can generate sparse portfolios with excellent out-of-sample excess returns and high robustness after deducting transaction costs.

J	Lim, DY; Neufeld, A; Sabanis, S; Zhang, Y				Lim, Dong-Young; Neufeld, Ariel; Sabanis, Sotirios; Zhang, Ying			Langevin Dynamics Based Algorithm e-THεO POULA for Stochastic Optimization Problems with Discontinuous Stochastic Gradient	MATHEMATICS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Langevin dynamics based algorithm; discontinuous stochastic gradient; nonconvex stochastic optimization; nonasymptotic convergence bound; artificial neural networks; ReLU activation function; taming technique; superlinearly growing coefficients	DEPENDENT DATA STREAMS; STRONG-CONVERGENCE	We introduce a new Langevin dynamics based algorithm, called the extended tamed hybrid epsilon-order polygonal unadjusted Langevin algorithm (e-TH epsilon O POULA), to solve optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, which naturally appear in real-world applications such as quantile estimation, vector quantization, conditional value at risk (CVaR) minimization, and regularized optimization problems involving rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the e-TH epsilon O POULA algorithm. More precisely, under the conditions that the stochastic gradient is locally Lipschitz in average and satisfies a certain convexity at infinity condition, we establish nonasymptotic error bounds for e-TH epsilon O POULA in Wasserstein distances and provide a nonasymptotic estimate for the expected excess risk, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small. Three key applications in finance and insurance are provided, namely, multiperiod portfolio optimization, transfer learning in multiperiod portfolio optimization, and insurance claim prediction, which involve neural networks with (Leaky)ReLU activation functions. Numerical experiments conducted using real-world data sets illustrate the superior empirical performance of e-TH epsilon O POULA compared with SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics), TUSLA (tamed unadjusted stochastic Langevin algorithm), adaptive moment estimation, and Adaptive Moment Estimation with a Strongly Non-Convex Decaying Learning Rate in terms of model accuracy.

J	Silva, T; Valladao, D; Homem-de-Mello, T				Silva, Thuener; Valladao, Davi; Homem-de-Mello, Tito			A data-driven approach for a class of stochastic dynamic optimization problems	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Stochastic programming; Distributionally robust dynamic optimization; Hidden Markov models; Risk constraints; Stochastic dual dynamic programming	DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST OPTIMIZATION; PROGRAMS; MODELS	Dynamic stochastic optimization models provide a powerful tool to represent sequential decision-making processes. Typically, these models use statistical predictive methods to capture the structure of the underlying stochastic process without taking into consideration estimation errors and model misspecification. In this context, we propose a data-driven prescriptive analytics framework aiming to integrate the machine learning and dynamic optimization machinery in a consistent and efficient way to build a bridge from data to decisions. The proposed framework tackles a relevant class of dynamic decision problems comprising many important practical applications. The basic building blocks of our proposed framework are: (1) a Hidden Markov Model as a predictive (machine learning) method to represent uncertainty; and (2) a distributionally robust dynamic optimization model as a prescriptive method that takes into account estimation errors associated with the predictive model and allows for control of the risk associated with decisions. Moreover, we present an evaluation framework to assess out-of-sample performance in rolling horizon schemes. A complete case study on dynamic asset allocation illustrates the proposed framework showing superior out-of-sample performance against selected benchmarks. The numerical results show the practical importance and applicability of the proposed framework since it extracts valuable information from data to obtain robustified decisions with an empirical certificate of out-of-sample performance evaluation.

J	Calomiris, CW; Mamaysky, H				Calomiris, Charles W.; Mamaysky, Harry			How news and its context drive risk and returns around the world	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Empirical asset pricing; International markets; Financial news media; Natural language processing	STOCK RETURNS; SENTIMENT; MOMENTUM	We develop a classification methodology for the context and content of news articles to predict risk and return in stock markets in 51 developed and emerging economies. A parsimonious summary of news, including topic-specific sentiment, frequency, and unusualness (entropy) of word flow, predicts future country-level returns, volatilities, and drawdowns. Economic and statistical significance are high and larger for year ahead than monthly predictions. The effect of news measures on market outcomes differs by country type and over time. News stories about emerging markets contain more incremental information. Out-of-sample testing confirms the economic value of our approach for forecasting country-level market outcomes.

J	Niu, YJ; Yang, JQ; Zou, ZT				Niu, Yingjie; Yang, Jinqiang; Zou, Zhentao			Disaster learning and aggregate investment	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY			English	Article						Learning; Rare disaster; Jump size; Growth volatility; Equity risk premium	LONG-RUN RISK; RARE DISASTERS; STOCK-MARKET; INTERTEMPORAL SUBSTITUTION; ASSET PRICES; CONSUMPTION; EXPECTATIONS; INFORMATION; VOLATILITY; ELASTICITY	We extend a production-based asset pricing model by introducing learning about disaster risk. The information is not perfect, and Bayesian learning is adopted to update beliefs about the likelihood of rare disasters. We show that disaster learning reconciles key stylized facts about macroeconomic quantities and financial markets. For macroeconomic quantities, during the crisis, the decline in aggregate investments is much worse than that of output, whereas the decline in aggregate consumption is moderate relative to that of output. Additionally, the model endogenously features lower consumption volatility and higher investment volatility than that of output. For financial markets, belief updating over a rare disaster produces a higher equity premium, lower risk-free rate, and more volatile stock returns. Finally, we show that jump intensity uncertainty accounts for a substantial fraction of the total welfare cost of rare disasters.

Our model features slow learning about firms' exposure to aggregate productivity shocks over time. In contrast to a full information case, our framework provides a unified explanation for the stylized empirical features of the cross-section of stocks that differ in capital age: old capital firms (1) have higher capital allocation efficiency; (2) are more ex-posed to aggregate productivity shocks and, hence, earn higher expected returns, which we refer to as capital age premium; and (3) have shorter cash-flow duration, when compared with young capital firms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

These strategies are in turn implemented through specific action plans, assuring the coherence and alignment between the different strategic hierarchical levels, beginning with business strategy, through category strategy to specific tactical sourcing levers. The proposed framework is the result of a longitudinal study executed through two action research cycles engaging in a strategic sourcing project in a leading European specialty steels manufacturer. By integrating and refining in our framework three dominant purchasing portfolio models i.e. Kraljic, Olsen & Ellram, and Scott & Westbrook - we highlight the importance of adopting multiple perspectives to manage the complexity of formulating a purchasing strategy and its related implementation decisions. The proposed framework has been designed to facilitate dynamic learning mechanisms through a feedback loop to continuously update the three integrated models and in turn allow managers to gain a strategic perspective of the evolution of buyer-supplier relationships, the influence of previous decisions and external factors. A critical discussion explores the proposed solution through the main theoretical lenses emerged throughout the research process.

J	Rong, YT; Liu, S; Yan, S; Huang, WW; Chen, YX				Rong, Yuting; Liu, Shan; Yan, Shuo; Huang, Wei Wayne; Chen, Yanxia			Proposing a new loan recommendation framework for loan allocation strategies in online P2P lending	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Online peer-to-peer lending; Loan allocation strategies; Modern portfolio theory	PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; SOFT INFORMATION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CREDIT RISK; PEER; PLATFORM; MARKET; DISCRIMINATION; TRANSFORMATION; APPEARANCE	PurposeLenders in online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are always non-experts and face severe information asymmetry. This paper aims to achieve the goals of gaining high returns with risk limitations or lowering risks with expected returns for P2P lenders.Design/methodology/approachThis paper used data from a leading online P2P lending platform in America. First, the authors constructed a logistic regression-based credit scoring model and a linear regression-based profit scoring model to predict the default probabilities and profitability of loans. Second, based on the predictions of loan risk and loan return, the authors constructed linear programming model to form the optimal loan portfolio for lenders.FindingsThe research results show that compared to a logistic regression-based credit scoring method, the proposed new framework could make more returns for lenders with risks unchanged. Furthermore, compared to a linear regression-based profit scoring method, the proposed new framework could lower risks for lenders without lowering returns. In addition, comparisons with advanced machine learning techniques further validate its superiority.Originality/valueUnlike previous studies that focus solely on predicting the default probability or profitability of loans, this study considers loan allocation in online P2P lending as an optimization research problem using a new framework based upon modern portfolio theory (MPT). This study may contribute theoretically to the extension of MPT in the specific context of online P2P lending and benefit lenders and platforms to develop more efficient investment tools.

J	Zhu, ZF; Zhang, NN; Zhu, K				Zhu, Zhoufan; Zhang, Ningning; Zhu, Ke			Big portfolio selection by graph-based conditional moments method	JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE			English	Article						Asset pricing knowledge; Big data; Big portfolio selection; Domain knowledge; High-dimensional time series; Machine learning; Quantiled conditional moments	QUANTILE REGRESSION; VOLATILITY; PREFERENCE; SKEWNESS; KURTOSIS; MODELS; LINKS	This paper proposes a new gra ph-based conditional moments (GRACE) method to do portfolio selection based on thousands of stocks or even more. The GRACE method first learns the conditional quantiles and mean of stock returns via a factor-augmented temporal graph convolutional network, which is guided by the set of stock-to-stock relations as well as the set of factor-to-stock relations. Next, the GRACE method learns the conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis of stock returns from the learned conditional quantiles via the quantiled conditional moment method. Finally, the GRACE method uses the learned conditional mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis to construct several performance measures, which are criteria to sort the stocks to proceed the portfolio selection in the well-known 10-decile framework. An application to NASDAQ and NYSE stock markets shows that the GRACE method performs much better than its competitors, particularly when the performance measures are comprised of conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

We investigate the optimal consumption, investment, and retirement decisions when the mean return of a risky asset is unobservable and is estimated by filtering from historical prices. To ensure nonnegativity of the consumption rate and the borrowing constraints on the wealth process of the representative agent, we conduct our analysis using a duality approach. We link the dual problem to American option pricing with stochastic volatility and prove that the duality gap is closed. We then apply our theory to a hidden Markov model for regime-switching mean return with Bayesian learning. We fully characterize the existence and uniqueness of variational inequality in the dual optimal stopping problem, as well as the free boundary of the problem. An asymptotic closed-form solution is derived for optimal retirement timing by small-scale perturbation. We discuss the potential applications of the results to other partial information settings.

Unlike traditional project management approaches for information system, the proposed approach considers the cumulative effect of all past experiences to achieve continuous performance and reliability prediction. The results of quantitative comparisons with other common estimation approaches, such as non-learning point estimates and traditional Bayesian approach, using real case data indicate that the proposed approach can generate a more realistic metric to continuously plan and measure the performance of evolving LeAgile projects or portfolios.

J	Lin, HL; Sun, QB				Lin, Hualing; Sun, Qiubi			Financial Volatility Forecasting: A Sparse Multi-Head Attention Neural Network	INFORMATION			English	Article						sparse multi-head attention; volatility forecasting; neural network; gradient problems	GARCH-TYPE; MODEL; FUTURES; REGIME; INDEX	Accurately predicting the volatility of financial asset prices and exploring its laws of movement have profound theoretical and practical guiding significance for financial market risk early warning, asset pricing, and investment portfolio design. The traditional methods are plagued by the problem of substandard prediction performance or gradient optimization. This paper proposes a novel volatility prediction method based on sparse multi-head attention (SP-M-Attention). This model discards the two-dimensional modeling strategy of time and space of the classic deep learning model. Instead, the solution is to embed a sparse multi-head attention calculation module in the network. The main advantages are that (i) it uses the inherent advantages of the multi-head attention mechanism to achieve parallel computing, (ii) it reduces the computational complexity through sparse measurements and feature compression of volatility, and (iii) it avoids the gradient problems caused by long-range propagation and therefore, is more suitable than traditional methods for the task of analysis of long time series. In the end, the article conducts an empirical study on the effectiveness of the proposed method through real datasets of major financial markets. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model on all real datasets surpasses all benchmark models. This discovery will aid financial risk management and the optimization of investment strategies.

J	Soma, T; Yoshida, Y				Soma, Tasuku; Yoshida, Yuichi			Online risk-averse submodular maximization	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Conditional value at risk; Submodular function; Stochastic optimization; Online learning		We present a polynomial-time online algorithm for maximizing the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of a monotone stochastic submodular function. Given T i.i.d. samples from an underlying distribution arriving online, our algorithm produces a sequence of solutions that converges to a (1 - 1/e)-approximate solution with a convergence rate of O(T (-1/4)) for monotone continuous DR-submodular functions. Compared with previous offline algorithms, which require (T ) space, our online algorithm only requires Omega( root T ) space. We extend our online algorithm to portfolio optimization for monotone submodular set functions under a matroid constraint. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can rapidly achieve CVaRs that are comparable to those obtained by existing offline algorithms.

J	Chen, AX; Liu, YK				Chen, Aixia; Liu, Yankui			Optimizing Technology R&D Supply Chain Problem Under Technology Concern Uncertainty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Technology R&D supply chain; Bi-level optimization; Distribution uncertainty; Robust fuzzy optimization contract	PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; FUZZY OPTIMIZATION; PRICE DISCOUNT; QUALITY; NETWORK; MANAGEMENT; SUBSIDY; DESIGN	Technology research and development (R&D) plays an increasingly critical role in emerging supply chains by endowing products with desirable technical features. Due to unpredictable market acceptance, the technology concern coefficient, namely, the sensitivity of price to the technology level of technological products is uncertain in the process of R&D, and usually only its partial distribution information can be obtained by referring to similar products or resorting to experts in related fields. It reflects the subjective uncertainty of technology concern, which is different from the existing relevant literature. Motivated by this challenge, we construct a new ambiguity set of possibility distributions to characterize the distribution uncertainty of technology concern and build a novel robust fuzzy tri-level optimization model for decision-making in technology R&D supply chain (tRDsc) with government subsidy. Based on the proposed ambiguity set, we have derived the closed-form equilibrium solutions to the developed robust optimization model. At the same time, the equilibrium under manufacturer subsidy is consistent with that under consumer subsidy. Besides, manufacturer subsidy is more beneficial to the supplier, while technology supplier subsidy benefits the manufacturer more when the subsidy ratio is big enough. Finally, an application case about electric vehicles is studied to illustrate the effectiveness of our new optimization method. The case study shows that the government's subsidy strategy may change when the uncertainty perturbation parameters change. That is, taking investment efficiency as the selection criterion, the change of perturbation set will influence subsidy policy choices.

J	Hoang, K; Faff, R				Hoang, Khoa; Faff, Robert			Is the ex-ante equity risk premium always positive? Evidence from a new conditional expectations model	ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article						Risk premium; Principal component; Regression tree; Inequality restriction; Conditional asset pricing model; Multiple hypothesis testing	EXPECTED RETURN; INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS; CROSS-SECTION; STOCK RETURNS; TESTS; SAMPLE; HETEROSKEDASTICITY; TRADEOFF; MARKET	We model the conditional risk premium by combining principal component analysis and a statistical learning technique, known as boosted regression trees. The method is validated through various out-of-sample tests. We apply the estimates to test the positivity restriction on the risk premium and find evidence that the risk premium is negative in periods of low corporate and government bond returns, high inflation and downward-sloping term structure. These periods are linked with changes in business cycles; the states when theories predict the existence of negative risk premium. Based on the evidence, we reject the conditional capital asset pricing model and raise a question over the practice of imposing the positive risk premium constraint in predictive models.

J	Agarwal, V; Taffler, RJ; Wang, CY				Agarwal, Vineet; Taffler, Richard J.; Wang, Chenyang			Investor emotions and market bubbles	REVIEW OF QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article; Early Access						Asset pricing bubbles; Chinese stock market; Economic narratives; Investor emotions; Textual analysis; G12; G15; G41	MEDIA; INFORMATION; LIQUIDITY; FAMA	Asset pricing bubbles are highly emotional market episodes. Despite this, investor emotions are not part of traditional bubble models. We measure the powerful affects influencing investor decisions during speculative market bubbles directly employing textual analysis of media narratives and domain-specific emotion keyword dictionaries and show how understanding investor emotional dynamics helps explain market behavior. Specifically, we focus on the two Chinese stock market bubbles of 2005-2008 and 2014-2016; there is no evidence of investor learning from experience. Despite Chinese media being censored we show it still has strong explanatory power although the independent English language media can provide an additional perspective. Deeper emotions dominate more superficial feelings in information content.

This involves the facts of risk of return, appreciating or depreciating of stock markets in value and dynamic circumstances. We present a design to study and discover bear and bull markets from macroeconomic variables in a probabilistic manner to assist the decision-making process. Features such as return, risk, simple, and exponential moving average are represented as flexible time series. The learning method that involves conditional dependence of stock variables and inference is described by the base of Bayesian theorem. We highlight our learning method using an actual case study with a consistent stock portfolio optimization. The case study addresses a set of selected stock symbols of VN-index and the logical method is illustrated by significant rates of accuracy over a variation of types of stock symbols.

Relevant economic parameters are determined and used for stock selection. Along with stock selection, weights for the stocks are obtained by solving a portfolio optimization problem using three methods: GRG Nonlinear, Evolutionary method based on Genetic Algorithm, and Equal weight method. The portfolio return in the proposed model is compared with the return of the Indian market portfolio (NSE and BSE). It is observed that the proposed model outperforms the market portfolio.

J	Johnson, P; Staveley-O'Carroll, J				Johnson, Paul; Staveley-O'Carroll, James			An exchange rate risk experiment with multiple currencies	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION			English	Article						Classroom experiment; cooperative learning; exchange rates; portfolio choice	TRADE; MARKETS	In this article, the authors describe a classroom experiment on exchange rates appropriate for undergraduate courses in macroeconomics, international economics, and money and banking. Student teams compete by managing virtual portfolios of six foreign currencies over a period of several weeks. Trading requires a few minutes in class. Students gain an understanding of currency movements, financial risk, and portfolio management. The experiment allows for a test of the efficient markets hypothesis. A single class spreadsheet is used to record the history of trades and portfolio balances, assist in formulation of team strategy, and provide the raw data for students to analyze their performance in an end-of-semester reflection paper. Sample outcomes from classes in money and banking and international economics are discussed.

J	Waldon, H				Waldon, Harrison			Forward robust portfolio selection: The binomial case	PROBABILITY UNCERTAINTY AND QUANTITATIVE RISK			English	Article						Forward robust portfolio selection; Binomial case; Optimal portfolio; Forward performance processes; Linear utilities; Quadratic utilities; Robust forward performance criteria	PERFORMANCE PROCESSES; INVESTMENT; AMBIGUITY; CHOICE	We introduce a new approach for optimal portfolio choice under model ambiguity by incorporating predictable forward preferences in the framework of Angoshtari et al. [2]. The investor reassesses and revises the model ambiguity set incrementally in time while, also, updating his risk preferences forward in time. This dynamic alignment of preferences and ambiguity updating results in time -consistent policies and provides a richer, more accurate learning setting. For each investment period, the investor solves a worst -case portfolio optimization over possible market models, which are represented via a Wasserstein neighborhood centered at a binomial distribution. Duality methods from Gao and Kleywegt [10]; Blanchet and Murthy [8] are used to solve the optimization problem over a suitable set of measures, yielding an explicit optimal portfolio in the linear case. We analyze the case of linear and quadratic utilities, and provide numerical results.

J	Zhang, JT; Liu, HF; Bai, W; Li, XJ				Zhang, Junting; Liu, Haifei; Bai, Wei; Li, Xiaojing			A hybrid approach of wavelet transform, ARIMA and LSTM model for the share price index futures forecasting	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						DWT-ARIMA-LSTM; Harr wavelet -based porous algorithm; Share price index futures; Timing trading strategy	NEURAL-NETWORK; STOCK; PREDICTION; VOLATILITY	In this study, a novel hybrid model for share price index futures forecasting named WT-ARIMALSTM is proposed. In this hybrid model, share price index futures are decomposed to extract data characteristics at different time scales by the wavelet transform and the ARIMA-LSTM model are applied to predict the close price of futures. The findings of the study are as follows. 1) The DWT hybrid model and the MODWT hybrid model have higher forecasting accuracy than some commonly used forecasting models under the three metrics of MAE, MAPE and RMSE. The DWTARIMA-LSTM model has better forecasting performance when the forecasting performance in different markets and the operational efficiency of the method are combined. 2) The DWT method is more applicable than the MODWT method in forecasting models of futures closing price series; the approximate signals obtained from the DWT decomposition have lower volatility and can better characterise the original signals. 3) The LSTM model has better prediction performance for noisy residual series, while the ARIMA model has better prediction performance for less noisy approximate signals. 4) Based on the forecasting results, a timing trading strategy is constructed that can maintain a robust return performance under different market conditions, especially on the risk side with significant advantages. In addition, this work examines the impact of the unexpected event of the COVID-19 epidemic on the forecasting performance of the model, and the results show that the model can adapt to different data structures to achieve more robust forecasting performance. This work provides insights into the integration of deep learning methods with econometric methods in the field of asset pricing.

This framework is broad enough to model many real-life repeated scenarios with restrictions, such as portfolio management, learning by doing and training. We present conditions under which rigidity in the choice of actions benefits all players in terms of worst-case equilibrium payoff and worst-case payoff. To provide structure, we exemplify our result in a model of a two-player repeated game, where we derive a formula for the worst-case payoff. Moreover, we show that in zero-sum games, lack of knowledge about the timing of the revision can compensate for inability to change the action.

In line with the empirical literature, investors display recency bias when revising their beliefs about the actual dividend process and recursively discount the precision of past observations. Recency-biased learning significantly improves the ability of the standard model to replicate the boom-and-bust episode on the US S&P 500 stock market in the run-up to the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath, along with features of subjective expectations of stock returns documented in survey data.

J	Tan, JH; Li, Q; Wang, J; Chen, JX				Tan, Jinghua; Li, Qing; Wang, Jun; Chen, Junxiao			FinHGNN: A conditional heterogeneous graph learning to address relational attributes for stock predictions	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Heterogeneous graph learning; Conditional messaging; Multiple spillovers; Stock prediction	NEURAL-NETWORK; MEDIA; NEWS	Recent financial studies have shown that spillover effects of some market factors play a sig-nificant role in stock fluctuations. Previous studies, however, were incapable of capturing the spillovers of these relational market factors because they relied on a homogeneous graph that condenses these factors into firm node attributes and requires their spillover effects to follow firm relationship instead of themselves. This fact brings up a heteroge-neous graph learning problem that requires multiple node types to transport different spil-lover effects. This study proposes a novel conditional heterogeneous graph neural network (FinHGNN) to capture multiple spillover effects in asset pricing with two uniquely designed mechanisms. First, it presents an efficient way to preserve the connectivity of relational attributes in graph learning, which is achieved by converting relational attributes into node variables to form a heterogeneous graph. Second, a conditional message-passing mechanism is proposed to handle multiple spillover effects simultaneously by messaging conditioned on different types of nodes and node attributes. This study paves the way for addressing the relational attributes in graph learning. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over three classic and four state-of-the-art algorithms, including LSTM, GCN, HGNN, eLSTM, TGC, FinGAT, and AD-GAT.

J	He, JA; Peng, FP				He, Jin'an; Peng, Fangping			Adaptive moment estimation for universal portfolio selection strategy	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Online learning; Universal portfolio selection; Adam algorithm; High-frequency trading	REVERSION STRATEGY; GRADIENT DESCENT; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Since Cover's initial work in 1991, Online Portfolio Selection is undoubtedly one of crucial branches of portfolio optimization problem. The increasing development of high-frequency trading and the explosive growth of data volume increasingly require online portfolio strategies to have fast execution speed. However, almost all existing online portfolio strategies cannot satisfy both effective and full utilization of historical data and fast execution speed simultaneously. To this end, this work proposes the Adaptive Moment Estimation (AME) strategy. The proposed strategy makes effective and full utilization of historical data in an incremental way, which not only achieves improved robustness in performance but also keeps linear time complexity. Theoretical and experimental analysis are respectively established to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed AME strategy. For theoretical analysis, AME's universality is proved, which illustrates that it can theoretically compete with the benchmark Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio in hindsight. For experimental analysis, AME achieves good performance on different evaluation metrics, and it can sustain reasonable transaction costs. Thus, it is a robust and excellent strategy with promising practical application prospects.

J	Kolm, PN; Westray, N				Kolm, Petter N.; Westray, Nicholas			Mean-Variance Optimization for Simulation of Order Flow	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article							IMPACT	In this article, the authors propose an order flow simulator for meta orders such as those originating from the trading activity of buy-side firms. The simulator is designed with three key goals in mind. First, it should be simple to use and to integrate into different applications. Second, it must be computationally efficient to handle many securities. Third, the simulated order flow should possess statistical properties similar to those of observed order flow in the market. The authors provide two empirical examples. In addition to illustrating some statistical properties of the order flow simulator, they use the simulator to estimate the number of trades needed to determine whether order flow from a buy-side firm has alpha.

A Data-Driven Guide to WallStreetBets	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								A trite yet fundamental question in economics is: What causes large asset price fluctuations? A 10-fold rise in the price of GameStop equity, between January 22, 2021, and January 28, 2021, demonstrated that herding behavior among retail investors is an important contributing factor. This article presents a data-driven guide to the forum that started the hype: WallStreetBets (WSB). The article's initial experiments decompose the forum using a large language topic model and network tools. The topic model describes the evolution of the forum over time and shows the persistence of certain topics (such as the market/S&P 500 discussion) and the sporadic interest in others, such as COVID-19 or crude oil. The authors use network analysis to decompose the landscape of retail investors into clusters based on their posting and discussion habits; several large, correlated asset discussion clusters emerge, surrounded by smaller, niche ones. A second set of experiments assesses the impact that WSB discussions have had on the market. The authors show that forum activity has a Granger causal relationship with the returns of several assets, some of which are now commonly classified as meme stocks, while others have gone under the radar.

J	DeBoeuf, DA				DeBoeuf, David A.			Structuring stock investment funds with a limited number of qualified students	MANAGERIAL FINANCE			English	Article						Diversification; Earnings; Students; Dividends; Business education; Valuations		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to outline the problems encountered by a student-managed investment program (SMIP) when the pool of qualified finance majors is limited in number. Restructuring the program to a single-semester course and opening the class to motivated/intelligent non-finance majors increased the number of applicants, but resulted in alternative difficulties, particularly time constraints and inadequate student preparedness. A prerequisite exam and regimented classroom structure were the solutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper discusses the problems encountered and solutions devised to address the early year difficulties experienced by a newly developed SMIP at a relatively small university. The core of the paper chronicles the classroom approach to solving the main problem of a single-semester portfolio management course, the handling of an investment learning curve in a short period of time. Findings Though empirically limited due to the program's infancy, portfolio performance has been encouraging and student feedback exceptional. Regarding the former, stocks purchased by the fund have created greater wealth in total than that of equal dollar investments in an S&P500 index fund. Practical implications Universities interested in running a student-managed fund should feel secure in a one-semester approach, regardless of talent pool size, as measured by the number of motivated, intelligent finance majors. Originality/value Aside from the uniqueness of requiring a mastery of entrance exam investing materials prior to the first class, this paper's outline of core portfolio management activities includes several strategies and methods meant to streamline the process within a groupthink design.

We find that there is a significant negative correlation between investor sentiment and the investor disposition effect. Moreover, affected by sentiment, the performance of investor disposition effect in the bull market and the bear market is quite opposite. The conclusion of this paper has certain theoretical and practical significance for understanding the disposition effect of investors, optimizing investors' selling decisions, and strengthening the construction of a basic system of the capital market.

We provide cross-sectional evidence that the difference is attributable, at least in part, to investor learning about opaque insurer liabilities. We also find that capital market and product market imperfections are important determinants of insurers' cost of equity capital. Overall, our evidence contributes to the important literature examining insurers' cost of equity capital, and it suggests that opaque liabilities are a distinguishing feature of insurers in determining their cost of equity capital.

Especially, the timely and accurate solution of portfolios is highly demanded in financial market nowadays. This article makes progress along this direction by proposing novel neural networks with softmax equalization to address the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that softmax technique is used to deal with equation constraints in portfolio selections. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method is globally convergent to the optimum of the optimization formulation of portfolio selection. Experiments based on real stock data verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution. It is worth mentioning that the two proposed models achieve 5.50% and 5.47% less cost, respectively, than the solution obtained by using MATLAB dedicated solvers, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed strategies.

Berk			Assessment of stored red blood cells through lab-on-a-chip technologies for precision transfusion medicine	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						red blood cells; transfusion; preservation	STORAGE LESION; EXCHANGE-TRANSFUSION; DURATION; SYSTEM; MICROFLUIDICS; METABOLOMICS; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; AGE; ANTICOAGULANT	Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is one of the most valuable and widespread treatments in modern medicine. Lifesaving RBC transfusions are facilitated by the cold storage of RBC units in blood banks worldwide. Currently, RBC storage and subsequent transfusion practices are performed using simplistic workflows. More specifically, most blood banks follow the "first in first out" principle to avoid wastage, whereas most healthcare providers prefer the "last in first out" approach simply favoring chronologically younger RBCs. Neither approach addresses recent advances through - omics showing that stored RBC quality is highly variable depending on donor-, time-, and processing-specific factors. Thus, it is time to rethink our workflows in transfusion medicine taking advantage of novel technologies to perform RBC quality assessment. We imagine a future where lab on a chip technologies utilize novel predictive markers of RBC quality identified by - omics and machine learning to usher in a new era of safer and precise transfusion medicine.

J	Röth, T; Heidenreich, S; Schweitzer, F; Spieth, P				Roeth, Tobias; Heidenreich, Sven; Schweitzer, Fiona; Spieth, Patrick			Navigating through learning tensions at the front end: How firms can motivate paradoxical thinking when screening the creativity of ideas	R & D MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; ANTECEDENTS; MODEL; CONSEQUENCES; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTS	Idea screening is crucial as it must select the most promising ideas that are best suited to increase front-end success. Although paradox theory indicates that learning tensions characterize the evaluation and screening of idea creativity, we know little about how idea screeners navigate through the associated competing demands. In response, we investigate the effects of idea screeners' paradoxical thinking on the assessment of the creativity of ideas as well as its motivational antecedents of paradoxical thinking. By analyzing a survey (N = 326) and an experiment (N = 292), we show that paradoxical thinking increases front-end success and both dimensions of idea creativity (encompassing meaningfulness and novelty). In turn, by creating a motivational context (comprising decision autonomy, encouragement to take risks, and tolerance for mistakes), firms can provide the antecedents to adopt paradoxical thinking. Our study contributes to and extends the literature on screening idea creativity and paradox theory.

The iterative nature of the proposed method enables online learning, useful for time-evolving data, such as stock price time series. This way, the computation of the covariance matrix is avoided whenever new data become available. Due to the non-negative constraints explicitly enforced, the extracted eigenvectors turn to be sparse without employing any sparsity controlling parameter. Accordingly, only one parameter has to be tuned, i.e., the learning rate. Also, the complexity of the method under study is approximately linear under plausible assumptions. To assess the method's performance, comprehensive experimental evaluation is conducted on both image and financial data. The proposed method is thoroughly compared to state-of-the-art and yields promising experimental findings.

Accelerating Learning in Active Management: <i>The Alpha-Brier Process</i>	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Statistical methods; portfolio construction; performance measurement	PROBABILITY; ACCURACY	Forecasting tournaments have shown it is possible to improve the accuracy of forecasts of real-world events that sophisticated observers often supposed are too idiosyncratic to be pinned down by numerical probabilities. Building on this research program, the authors propose the Alpha-Brier process to help firms improve forecasts guiding investment decisions. Alpha-Brier offers four major benefits: (1) It reduces the noisiness of vague-verbiage forecasts, such as X "might" or "could" happen, that are open to varying interpretations; (2) it makes it easier to distinguish skill from luck as drivers of portfolio performance; (3) it gives investors faster feedback on the accuracy of their probability judgments; and (4) it lets managers test which methods of training, incentivizing, and aggregating judgments deliver the biggest boosts to accuracy. Paradoxically, the more pervasive the skepticism toward the core premise of Alpha-Brier that probability judgments can be extended to superficially unique events, the more opportunities there will be for firms to exploit market inefficiencies linked to overreliance on vague-verbiage forecasts.

On the Analysis of Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Schemes for Misspecified Conic Convex Programs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						Algorithm design and analysis; augmented lagrangian methods; computational complexity; misspecified optimization; optimization methods	STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; GRADIENT	In this article, we consider the misspecified optimization problem of minimizing a convex function f(x; theta*) in x over a conic constraint set represented by h(x; theta*) is an element of K, where theta* is an unknown (or misspecified) vector of parameters, K is a closed convex cone, and h is affine in x. Suppose that theta* is unavailable but may be learnt by a separate process that generates a sequence of estimators theta(k), each of which is an increasingly accurate approximation of theta*. We develop a first-order inexact augmented Lagrangian (AL) scheme for computing an optimal solution x* corresponding to theta* while simultaneously learning theta*. In particular, we derive rate statements for such schemes when the penalty parameter sequence is either constant or increasing and derive bounds on the overall complexity in terms of proximal gradient steps when AL subproblems are inexactly solved via an accelerated proximal gradient scheme. Numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem with a misspecified covariance matrix suggest that these schemes perform well in practice, while naive sequential schemes may perform poorly in comparison.

This paper uses the Easteconomy stock forum and Sina stock forum as the carrier of investor sentiment to measure the positive sentiment index based on stockholders' comments and to construct an evaluation index system for the public opinion dimension. In addition, the evaluation index system is constructed from four dimensions, which include operation, innovation, finance and financing, to evaluate the overall condition of listed companies from multiple perspectives. In this paper, the SBM model in the data envelopment analysis method is used to measure the efficiency values of each dimension of the multidimensional efficiency evaluation index system, and the efficiency values of each dimension are the multidimensional efficiency indicators. Subsequently, two sets of input feature indicators of the SVM model were established: one set contains traditional financial indicators and multidimensional efficiency indicators, and another set has only traditional financial indicators. The early warning accuracy of the two sets of input feature indicators was empirically analyzed based on the support vector machine early warning model. The results show that the early warning model incorporating multidimensional efficiency indicators has improved the accuracy compared with the early warning model based on traditional financial indicators. Then, the model was optimized by the particle swarm intelligent optimization algorithm, and the robustness of the results was tested. Moreover, six mainstream machine learning methods, including Logistic Regression, GBDT, CatBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest and Bagging, were used to compare with the early warning effect of the DEA-SVM model, and the empirical results show that DEA-SVM has high early warning accuracy, which proves the superiority of the proposed model. The findings of this study have a positive effect on further preventing and controlling the financial crisis risk of Chinese-listed companies and promoting as well as facilitating the healthy growth of Chinese-listed companies.

In contrast, the novel approach introduced in this study constructs a topographical map demarcating the relative importance, dispersion, and interrelationship among many finance topics. The final product is a bird's eye view of the whole literature illustrating historical trends, concentrations, and territories. We apply qualitative analysis, purposive sampling, and syntactic analysis to 34,261 articles published in 52 journals over the past two decades. First, we analyze the proliferation and historical development of topics. We find that a few topics (e.g., insurance) are losing ground to newer ones (e.g., blockchain and digital currency). However, several topics seem to occupy a stable, sizeable portion of finance literature (e.g., investment strategies and portfolio management). Next, we analyze the relationship between topics and journals and report strong tendencies that are not always confined by the traditional scope of journals. For instance, papers addressing investment strategy and portfolio management issues seem to appear in numerous journals; while special topics such as blockchain, digital currencies, dividends, and real estate can only be found in a limited number of journals. We also report strong interdependence among topics. More than a third of the papers screened in this study discuss two topics or more. We identify a list of topics that are likely to be investigated jointly. Overall, our work demonstrates the historical evolution of the entire finance literature; and identifies fertile areas for future research.

A one-standard-deviation increase in this index leads to a 4.14% increase in the expected excess return over the next month. Furthermore, a mean-variance investor can realize sizable economic gains by using this spillover index in his/her asset allocation. The forecasting power of the spillover index remains significant after controlling for popular economic variables and newly proposed predictors. Due to the absence of learning, the spillover index shows increasing predictive ability over the recent period. The economic origins of the spillover index's success stem from both the cash flow and discount rate channels, as well as significant association with investor sentiment and tail risk. The return predictability of this index is pervasive across characteristic-sorted portfolios and is particularly strong for large-cap or difficult-to-value stocks.

Evidence from French and UK equity markets	SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS			English	Article						Herding; SMEs; Large capitalizations; Asymmetry; Liquidity; Cross-country effects	STOCK RETURNS; CROSS-SECTION; FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS; PRIVATE EQUITY; BEHAVIOR; LIQUIDITY; GROWTH; INVESTMENT; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE	According to the social learning literature, agents faced with asymmetries rationally ignore their own information to follow the herd. We argue that investors in listed SMEs that are known for their high informational opacity exhibit more herding compared to investors in large firms in order to lower the impact of informational asymmetries. Given a gap in the listed SMEs' literature, we test our hypothesis offering first time evidence on their herding behavior. The results support our hypothesis. Herding is more prevalent among listed SMEs (known as micro-caps in the US) during normal periods, while during crisis periods, all micro-cap investors are faced with the same informational problem and do not herd because they expect that none of them has information of better quality. In addition, we reveal cross-market herding effects and a positive link of liquidity and herding. The results have implications for portfolio management and regulatory authorities among others.

We introduce a behavioural heterogeneous agents' model with bounded rationality by including a correction mechanism through representativeness (Gennaioli et al., 2015). To inspect the market crash induced by the pandemic, we calibrate the STOXX Europe 600 Index, when stock markets suffered from the greatest single-day percentage drop ever. Once the extreme event materializes, agents tend to be more sensitive to all positive and negative news, subsequently moving on to close-to-rational. We find that the deflation mechanism of less representative news seems to disappear after the extreme event.

J	Leung, MF; Wang, J				Leung, Man-Fai; Wang, Jun			Minimax and Biobjective Portfolio Selection Based on Collaborative Neurodynamic Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Optimization; Portfolios; Neurodynamics; Collaboration; Linear programming; Standards; Neural networks; Conditional value-at-risk; mean-variance (MV); minimax optimization; multiobjective optimization; neurodynamics; portfolio selection	RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORK; PARTICLE SWARM; HEAT ENGINE; FINANCE; RISK; EQUILIBRIUM; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; STRATEGIES; MODEL	Portfolio selection is one of the important issues in financial investments. This article is concerned with portfolio selection based on collaborative neurodynamic optimization. The classic Markowitz mean-variance (MV) framework and its variant mean conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are formulated as minimax and biobjective portfolio selection problems. Neurodynamic approaches are then applied for solving these optimization problems. For each of the problems, multiple neural networks work collaboratively to characterize the efficient frontier by means of particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based weight optimization. Experimental results with stock data from four major markets show the performance and characteristics of the collaborative neurodynamic approaches to the portfolio optimization problems.

While the effectiveness of deep graph learning is recognized across various disciplines, the nuances of vague graph learning - whether its inherent vagueness should be incorporated or disregarded and its influence on deep graph learning efficiency - remain largely unexamined. We fill this gap by introducing a novel decoupled graph learning framework. This is achieved by proposing a matrix-based or a tensor-based fusion module to estimate unobservable node attributes, a hybrid attention mechanism to bridge nodes with both explicit and implicit relationships, and a message-passing mechanism for feature-sensitive transporting. The design principle of decoupling allows it to accommodate ambiguities in any or all of these aspects of node representation, linking, and message passing. Furthermore, we leverage an extensive stock dataset spanning 64 years across the entire U.S. market to assess our framework. This real-world data not only adds a practical dimension to our study but also highlights the effectiveness of vague graph learning. Remarkably, our framework demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms, marking performance enhancements of at least 6.73%, 7.25%, and 11.39% in terms of Rank IC, $R<^>{2}$R2, and Rank ICIR, respectively.

In order to be considered competent, individuals working in the field should demonstrate a certain level of knowledge, skills, and abilities - assessed, developed or improved through a certification system. Taking into account the importance of information modeling and technology in the domain of project management as a set of practices that determine structure, lifecycle and accessibility requirements of information and the emphasis placed on the behavioral competencies of project, program and portfolio managers, the authors of the paper focused on exploring the challenges and specificities of the project management profession in Croatia. Empirical research was conducted in two steps. Firstly, a qualitative research was done using in-depth interviews with a member of the editorial board of a new project management international certification standard and two representatives of the certification body in Croatia: the director and the assessor. The collected data were analyzed using grounded theory approach and results in four main areas were obtained: project management and certification challenges, addressing certification body needs, the missing link between educational institutions and project management in practice and key project management competencies. In the next step, a quantitative research with a questionnaire as a research instrument was conducted among 53 certified project, program and portfolio managers in Croatia regarding their perception of the importance of the behavioral project management competencies. The results show that the majority of the certified experts in the field consider "leadership" to be the most important behavioral project management competency, closely followed by teamwork and self-management, while relations and engagement, conflict and crisis as well as negotiation and resourcefulness are considered to be of the least importance for conducting the project, program, and portfolio successfully. Statistically significant differences in assigning importance to various project management competencies were revealed with regard to several respondents' independent characteristics.

J	Ünlü, R; Xanthopoulos, P				Unlu, Ramazan; Xanthopoulos, Petros			A reduced variance unsupervised ensemble learning algorithm based on modern portfolio theory	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						consensus clustering; ensemble learning; internal quality measures; Markowitz's portfolio theory	CONSENSUS	Unsupervised ensemble learning or consensus clustering has gained popularity due to its ability to combine multiple clustering solutions into a single solution that is robust and often performs better than the individual ones. There have been several approaches to consensus clustering including voting and weighted voting algorithmic schemes. Although there have been several algorithms for adjusting the weights of a consensus clustering all of them are tuned based on some performance characteristic associated with clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for incorporating weights by taking into consideration the intra algorithmic variability i.e. algorithms that provide solutions with very different performance upon multiple runs. The methodology is inspired by modern portfolio theory and more specifically from Markowitz model for asset allocation where one is trying to identify the most efficient portfolio through the solution of a convex optimization problem. Here, efficiency is defined as the minimum amount of risk for an expected return. We apply this method to different datasets and compare with respect to performance and robustness. The proposed scheme appears to achieve competitive average performance with very low variability.

We argue rational learning models do not explain speculative trading by studying day traders in Taiwan. Consistent with previous studies of learning, unprofitable day traders are more likely than profitable traders to quit. Consistent with models of overconfidence and biased learning (but not with rational learning), the aggregate performance of day traders is negative; 74% of day trading volume is generated by traders with a history of losses; and 97% of day traders are likely to lose money in future day trading.

In contrast, the constraint of the maximum capacity of the knapsack is satisfied. KP01 has many applications in real-world complex problems such as resource distribution, portfolio optimization, etc. This study reviews the basic theory and main algorithms of 0-1 knapsack, proposes many different types of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, and divides existing 0-1 knapsack problems into 6 types according to the different coding methods of the algorithms, for a comprehensive overview of it. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the recent advances in 0-1 knapsack problem is presented. Literature survey reveals some interesting challenges and future research directions.

J	Tseng, K				Tseng, Kevin			Learning from the Joneses: Technology spillover, innovation externality, and stock returns	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING & ECONOMICS			English	Article						Technology spillover; Externality; Natural experiments; Information flow; Disclosure; Stock returns	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CORPORATE DISCLOSURE; CROSS-SECTION; TRADE SECRETS; MARKET; INFORMATION; PATENTS; OPPORTUNITY; VALUATION; KNOWLEDGE	This paper provides empirical evidence for the role of technology spillover, an important innovation externality, in asset pricing. Using patent and R&D data, I show that firms with more technology spillover earn 7.7% higher annualized returns than firms with less technology spillover. Exploiting three quasi-natural experiments, I find that the return effect is strengthened (attenuated) when there is a plausibly exogenous increase (decrease) in the flow of technological information across firms. I also find that firms with more technology spillover have higher cash flow sensitivity to aggregate consumption, numbers of new products, and stock return synchronicity. These findings are consistent with models on learning about new technology; specifically, spillover enables learning about new technology to facilitate timely and large-scale adoption of new technology, which in turn exposes spillover recipients to additional systematic risk. These findings highlight the influence of innovation externality on stock returns. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, with stock return and risk as indicators of firm performance, we investigate how DPS investment affects the financial performance of BDA firms (firms with BDA investment) and non-BDA firms (firms without BDA investment). We use a difference-in-differences approach and apply the propensity score matching to 1400 DPS announcements made by 228 US firms whose stocks are publicly traded on US stock markets from 2004 to 2018. The main findings are as follows: (1) On average, DPS investment significantly reduces firms' systematic risk. (2) The risk reduction effects are greater for non-BDA firms than for BDA firms. Our results indicate that DPS investment reduces firm risk and that the business value of specific information technology (IT) investment (e.g., DPS) is influenced by firms' other IT assets (e.g., BDA). The present findings advance the literature on the business value of IT and firms' IT portfolio management in digitized business environments.

To solve the EIT problem, many approaches have been proposed. However, it still remains a critical challenge to efficiently generate a portfolio with good quality. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach named IntelliPortfolio for the EIT problem. IntelliPortfolio uses PCA and clustering to select stock and estimates the investment weight for each constituent stock using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Two advantages of the proposed algorithm are as follows. (1) It considers both the fundamentals and the price information for stocks and can balance the trade-off between the performance and the diversity of the selected stocks. (2) It uses a LSTM model to estimate investment weights, which is more capable to handle long sequences of input and is more robust to predict the future trend of stock market.

J	Phillips, M; Volker, J; Cockrell, S				Phillips, Michael; Volker, John; Cockrell, Susan			A student-managed investment fund course design structure	MANAGERIAL FINANCE			English	Article						Investments; Course design; Student-centered learning environment; Student-managed investment fund; Student-managed portfolio		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed framework of goals, processes and solutions that can serve as a starting point for instructors in designing their own student-managed investment fund (SMIF) course experience that is relevant for all undergraduate business majors. Design/methodology/approach The design is suitable for a wide audience without prior equity investment expertise, lead to equity portfolio management competency and concentrate heavily on the understanding of the elements of a competitive business model. One noteworthy aspect of the proposed pedagogy is that it does not require a text, uses only real-world resources and is flexible in its execution. Findings The proposed pedagogy has achieved long-term success by consistently exceeding performance expectations. Originality/value According to the extant literature, many SMIFs are restricted to only a few students, develop skills unevenly across class participants, or are not formally organized or executed. There is a lack of in-depth and specific resources available in the extant literature to assist course designers in an SMIF design and execution. This manuscript fills this void by providing a detailed framework of goals, processes and solutions that can serve as a starting point for instructors in designing their own SMIF course experience.

The flow-based generative network learns simulated large-scale two-dimensional random states based on two stochastic volatility (SV) models. As a result, the generative network can efficiently simulate the random states within a short time. Furthermore, they can provide explicit probability density functions for the SV models due to the unique advantage of flow-based generative models. These lead to fairly exact option prices being achieved by simulating random states with the network or integrating option payoffs for the network-based density. Finally, we compare the network-based prices with those of naive Monte-Carlo simulation in terms of accuracy and time cost to show the superior performance of the proposed method.

Observer and control design in partially observable finite Markov chains	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						Observer design; Partially observed; Optimal control; Markov chains		The controllable Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework has proven to be useful in different domains where one is constrained to provide incomplete information of the structure and the parameters of the problem. Sometimes, it is not easy to track and measure accurately some state variables, and it may be more effective to make decisions based on imprecise information. This paper is focused on the design of an observer (which is unknown) for a class of ergodic homogeneous finite Markov chains with partially observable states. The main goal of the proposed method is the derivation of formulas for computing an observer, and as a result, on optimal control policy. For solving the problem, we introduce a new variable, which involves the product of the policy, the observation kernel and the distribution vector. We derive the formulas to recover the variables of interest. This work considers a dynamic environment for learning the parameters of the POMDP model. The construction of the adaptive policies is based on an identification approach, where we estimate the elements of the transition matrices and utility matrices by counting the number of unobserved experiences. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the practical implications of the theoretical issues applied to a portfolio optimization problem. These findings are important and new to the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studying the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences is crucial to engineering design as it provides a dynamic perspective for understanding the trend of customer preferences. However, existing choice models for demand modeling do not take the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences into consideration. Learning-based spatiotemporal data modeling methods usually require large-scale datasets for model training, which are not applicable to small aggregated data, such as the sale records of a product in several regions and years. To fill this research gap, we propose a spatial panel modeling approach to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer preferences. Product and regional attributes varying in time are included as model inputs to support demand forecasting in engineering design. With case studies using the dataset of small SUVs and compact sedans in China's automotive market, we demonstrate that the spatial panel modeling approach outperforms other statistical spatiotemporal data models and non-parametric regression methods in goodness of fit and prediction accuracy. We also illustrate a potential design application of the proposed approach in a portfolio optimization of two vehicles from the same producer. While the spatial panel modeling approach exists in econometrics, applying this approach to support engineering decisions by considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity and introducing engineering attributes in demand forecasting is the contribution of this work. Our paper is focused on presenting the approach rather than the results per se.

Identification of fundamental load shape profiles for benchmarking buildings using a large and diverse dataset	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Building energy; Load profile; Energy benchmarking; Unsupervised learning; Data analytic; Visual analytic	ENERGY BENCHMARKING; CLASSIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; MODEL	Buildings are responsible for 30-40% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption worldwide. Thus, reducing the overall energy use and associated emissions in buildings is crucial for meeting sustainability goals for the future. In recent years, smart energy meters have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy use data with hourly or sub-hourly temporal resolution. The concurrent rise of information technologies and data analytics enabled the development of novel applications such as customer segmentation, load profiling, demand response, energy forecasting and anomaly detection. In this paper, we address load profiling and benchmarking, i.e., determining peer groups for buildings. Traditionally, static characteristics, e.g., primary space use (PSI)) together with the annual energy-use-intensity (EUI) have been used to compare the performance of buildings. Data-driven benchmarking approaches have begun to also consider the shape of the load profiles as a means for comparison. In this work, we identify three fundamental load shape profiles that characterize the temporal energy use in any building. We obtain this result by collecting a dataset of unprecedented variety in size (3829 buildings) and primary use (75 programs), and applying a rigorous clustering analysis followed by entropy calculation for each building. The existence of fundamental load shape profiles challenges the manmade, artificial classification of buildings. We demonstrate in a benchmarking application that the resulting data-driven groups are more homogeneous, and therefore more suitable for comparisons between buildings. Our findings have potential implications for portfolio management, building and urban energy simulations, demand response and renewable energy integration in buildings.

While surveys are helpful to establish a link between subjective beliefs and investment decisions, precise inference about how investors depart from rational expectations can be challenging without relying on strong assumptions. In this article, we provide direct experimental evidence of how systematic distortions in investors' expectations affect their risk-taking across market cycles. As mechanism, we identify an asymmetry in how individuals update their expectations across boom and bust markets. The documented mechanism is consistent with survey data and provides important implications for recently proposed asset pricing models.

Using a variety of vector autoregressive models, the investor is able, each period, to learn about important data features. The developed methodology synthesizes a wide array of established approaches for modeling exchange rate dynamics. In a thorough investigation of monthly exchange rate predictability for 10 countries, we find that using the proposed methodology for dynamic asset allocation achieves substantial economic gains out of sample. In particular, we find evidence for sparsity, fast model switching, and exploitation of the exchange rate cross-section.

J	Wei, L; Chengshu, W				Wei, Li; Chengshu, Wu			Company ESG performance and institutional investor ownership preferences	BUSINESS ETHICS THE ENVIRONMENT & RESPONSIBILITY			English	Article						ESG responsibility performance; institutional investors; intermediary effect; shareholding preference	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FIRM; GOVERNANCE; INVESTMENTS	Heterogeneous institutional investors' shareholding preferences have been driven to change by the deepening of ESG investment philosophy. Therefore, we examine the impact of corporate ESG performance on institutional investors' shareholding preferences and its mechanism of action. We conduct mixed OLS and mediation effect tests using data on ESG responsibility scores and institutional investors' shareholding ratios of A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2020 as samples. We find that corporate ESG performance can significantly and robustly increase institutional investors' shareholdings; the mediation effect analysis shows that overall corporate ESG performance contributes to increases in corporate book and market values, thus encouraging institutional investors to increase their shareholdings. The heterogeneity analysis shows that independent institutional investors attach more importance to corporate ESG responsibility performance, and long-term institutional investors attach more importance to corporate environmental performance; moreover, institutional investors have more significant ESG shareholding preferences for Chinese SOEs. Our study can strengthen the encouragement of institutional investors to integrate ESG investment concepts from multiple perspectives, such as research and analysis, portfolio management, risk control, and due diligence management, to design and develop targeted ESG investment tools, give full play to the role of shareholders and guide the sound development of listed companies from the perspective of investment strategy objectives.

Erhan			Assessment of process capabilities in transition to a data-driven organisation: A multidisciplinary approach	IET SOFTWARE			English	Article							BIG DATA; DATA ANALYTICS; MATURITY; MODEL; MANAGEMENT	The ability to leverage data science can generate valuable insights and actions in organisations by enhancing data-driven decision-making to find optimal solutions based on complex business parameters and data. However, only a small percentage of the organisations can successfully obtain a business value from their investments due to a lack of organisational management, alignment, and culture. Becoming a data-driven organisation requires an organisational change that should be managed and fostered from a holistic multidisciplinary perspective. Accordingly, this study seeks to address these problems by developing the Data Drivenness Process Capability Determination Model (DDPCDM) based on the ISO/IEC 330xx family of standards. The proposed model enables organisations to determine their current management capabilities, derivation of a gap analysis, and the creation of a comprehensive roadmap for improvement in a structured and standardised way. DDPCDM comprises two main dimensions: process and capability. The process dimension consists of five organisational management processes: change management, skill and talent management, strategic alignment, organisational learning, and sponsorship and portfolio management. The capability dimension embraces six levels, from incomplete to innovating. The applicability and usability of DDPCDM are also evaluated by conducting a multiple-case study in two organisations. The results reveal that the proposed model is able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of an organisation in adopting, managing, and fostering the transition to a data-driven organisation and providing a roadmap for continuously improving the data-drivenness of organisations.

J	Huerta, D; Pyles, M				Huerta, Daniel; Pyles, Mark			A dual portfolio approach to a student managed fund	MANAGERIAL FINANCE			English	Article						Student investment portfolio; Student managed fund; A22; A29; G11		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe an investment program that offers students with the opportunity to simultaneously manage a private asset fund and a public asset fund. The program has been in operation since 2013 and has made significant progress in student placement and connectivity with local, regional and national financial firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors describe the structure, methods used and challenges encountered in this dual portfolio environment and add relevant thoughts for discussion. The authors discuss potential conflicts of interests that may arise in managing a private equity portfolio, the concern of proper deal flow, the issue of the investment timeline when investing in private equity and the problems encountered when measuring private equity performance. Findings While public asset funds have been around for decades and are relatively well accepted throughout all levels and types of higher education institutions. The uses of private equity funds, though not unheard of, are much less prevalent. Allowing the same group of students to manage both type of portfolios is relatively unique and provides with a more comprehensive learning experience. Originality/value A primary distinguishing attribute of this program is that accepted students are given the opportunity to simultaneously manage both public and private equity assets throughout an academic year. The goal is to create a comprehensive portfolio management program that replicates a changing investment management environment where private equity is an increasingly significant asset class.

J	Dubiel-Teleszynski, T; Kalogeropoulos, K; Karouzakis, N				Dubiel-Teleszynski, Tomasz; Kalogeropoulos, Konstantinos; Karouzakis, Nikolaos			Sequential Learning and Economic Benefits from Dynamic Term Structure Models	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						bond return predictability; economic value; dynamic term structure models; Bayesian sequential learning; parameter & model uncertainty	MONTE-CARLO METHODS; VARIABLE SELECTION; MACRO FACTORS; RETURNS; PREMIA; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; INFERENCE; SAMPLE; RATES	We explore the statistical and economic importance of restrictions on the dynamics of risk compensation from the perspective of a real-time Bayesian learner who predicts bond excess returns using dynamic term structure models (DTSMs). The question on whether potential statistical predictability offered by such models can generate economically significant portfolio benefits out-of-sample is revisited while imposing restrictions on their risk premia parameters. To address this question, we propose a methodological framework that successfully handles sequential model search and parameter estimation over the restriction space in real time, allowing investors to revise their beliefs when new information arrives, thus informing their asset allocation and maximizing their expected utility. Empirical results reinforce the argument of sparsity in the market price of risk specification since we find strong evidence of out-of-sample predictability only for those models that allow for level risk to be priced and, additionally, only one or two of these risk premia parameters to be different than zero. Most importantly, such statistical evidence is turned into economically significant utility gains, across prediction horizons, different time periods and portfolio specifications. In addition to identifying successful DTSMs, the sequential version of the stochastic search variable selection scheme developed can be applied on its own and offer useful diagnostics monitoring key quantities over time. Connections with predictive regressions are also provided.

J	Honkanen, P; Schmidt, D				Honkanen, Pekka; Schmidt, Daniel			Learning from Noise? Price and Liquidity Spillovers around Mutual Fund Fire Sales	REVIEW OF ASSET PRICING STUDIES			English	Article							S-AND-P-500 INDEX ADDITIONS; DEMAND CURVES; STOCK RETURNS; CROSS-SECTION; MARKET; INFORMATION; TIME; COMMONALITY; MODEL; REAL	We study the extent of cross-asset learning in financial markets by examining the spillover effects around mutual fund fire sales, which lead to a well-documented impact-reversal pattern in returns. We find that the returns of fire sale stocks spill over onto the stock returns of economic peers with a magnitude of around one-third of the original effect. These spillovers extend to liquidity and are not explained by common funding shocks or the hedging activity of liquidity providers. We conclude that they represent information spillovers due to learning from prices, thus identifying cross-asset learning as an important driver for the commonality in returns and liquidity.

The challenge arises from the complexity due to the time-variant property of time series and the inevitable diminishing utility of predictive models. Therefore, it is generally difficult to accurately predict values, especially in a multi-step ahead setting. However, in domains such as financial time series forecasting, an ex-ante prediction of the relative order of values in the near future is sufficient; i.e., the next 100 days can help make meaningful investment decisions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic prediction framework that makes it possible to make an ex-ante forecast of time series with a special focus on the relative ordering of the forecast within a forward-looking time horizon. Through the lens of the concordance index (CI), we compare the proposed method with conventional regression-based time-series forecasting methods, discriminative learning methods and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the use of the proposed framework for different types of time series and under a variety of conditions. Extensive experimental results on financial time series across a majority of liquid asset classes show that the proposed framework outperforms the benchmark methods significantly.

Specifically, the research of the investment for academic purposes is not mature enough due to the disarray of the publications and the overwhelming informative experience from profit-making websites. Often, some authors entitle the stock price prediction as a stock selection problem; both prediction and selection are just sub-sections of portfolio management. Moreover, stock websites provide numerous potential criteria showing various evaluations to simulate and monitor the stock market professionally, which increases the difficulty of academic studies on stock selection.The paper generalizes a novel framework with a user-interactive interface for stock selection problems based on multi-source data fusion and decision-level fusion to enhance reliability limited by the narrow criteria performance and the strength of a model overcoming the weakness of a single-performed model. This framework benefits the time-series prediction and decision-making study. Besides, we propose adopting dynamic time warping to assist a task-learning process by customizing a loss function that improves the accuracy of data prediction. The experiment shows that the proposed method reduces the prediction log error by 6.3% on average and decreases the warping cost by 5.6% on average over all cases of real-situation data. Finally, we illustrate the proposed framework by implementing it in a real-world stock data selection. The results are practical and effective, further justified through a detailed ablation study.

J	Broby, D				Broby, Daniel			The use of predictive analytics in finance	JOURNAL OF FINANCE AND DATA SCIENCE			English	Article						Predictive analytics; Finance; Fintech; Regtech; Risk; Statistics; Machine learning; Decision support systems; Information systems	ASSET PRICING MODEL; PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; METHODOLOGY; ECONOMICS; ACCURACY; OUTLIERS; RULES; FRAUD	Statistical and computational methods are being increasingly integrated into Decision Support Systems to aid management and help with strategic decisions. Researchers need to fully understand the use of such techniques in order to make predictions when using financial data. This paper therefore presents a method based literature review focused on the predictive analytics domain. The study comprehensively covers classification, regression, clustering, association and time series models. It expands existing explanatory statistical modelling into the realm of computational modelling. The methods explored enable the prediction of the future through the analysis of financial time series and cross-sectional data that is collected, stored and processed in Information Systems. The output of such models allow financial managers and risk oversight professionals to achieve better outcomes. This review brings the various predictive analytic methods in finance together under one domain. (c) 2022 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co. Ltd.

J	Ammermann, P; Gupta, P; Ma, YL				Ammermann, Peter; Gupta, Pia; Ma, Yulong			The learning experience continues: two decades and counting for CSULB's SMIF program	MANAGERIAL FINANCE			English	Article						New quantitative approach; Student-managed investment fund		Purpose The student-managed investment fund (SMIF) program at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), was launched in 1995 with one portfolio worth $50,000. In the two decades since then, the program has grown to include three portfolios with a combined value of more than $700,000, managed on behalf of three different clients. The purpose of this paper is to describe the creation, evolution and growth of the program including the development of the new quantitative approach and its subsequent implementation. The paper also discusses the ongoing organizational, educational and investment-management challenges associated with the program. Design/methodology/approach The paper includes a description of the development and evolution of the program along with a discussion of the investment results for one of its three portfolios. Findings The paper finds: the new quantitative approach implemented in the program is effective as insurance against "black swan" events; and SMIF-type programs can provide learning experiences both for students and faculty members. Practical implications The paper explains the practical application of the new quantitative approach as well as the educational benefits of a SMIF-type program. Originality/value The paper provides insight into the structure of CSULB's SMIF program and discusses a unique quantitative approach to asset allocation and security selection.

We assume that the return rate of the stock depends on an observable and an unobservable state variables, and the pension manager estimates the unobservable component from known information through Bayesian learning. Under the criterion of expected exponential utility maximization, we obtain the optimal strategy in closed-form through the dynamic programming principle approach. Furthermore, numerical simulations are conducted by the Monte Carlo method to discuss the impacts of some parameters on the derived optimal strategy and to compare the optimal strategy with the suboptimal strategy when ignoring learning. It turns out that neglecting learning affects the optimal strategy seriously, thereby leading to significant utility losses.

This model does not have any exact pricing formulas for vanilla options, and neural networks have an outstanding ability to approximate various functions. Surprisingly, the network reduces the simulation noise by itself, thereby achieving accuracy equal to large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation. Extremely high accuracy cannot be attained via existing approximate formulas. Moreover, the network is as efficient as the approaches based on the formulas. When evaluating accuracy and efficiency, extensive networks can eliminate the necessity of pricing formulas for the SABR model. Another significant contribution is that a novel method is proposed to examine the errors based on nonlinear regression. This approach is easily extendable to other pricing models for which it is hard to deduce analytic formulas. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data were analyzed using a team-based framework analysis using an inductive and deductive approach and mapping responses to the National Competency Standards.Results: A total of 143 interview transcripts were included in the analysis. The top skills mentioned were leadership of self (98.6%) and communication and collaboration (96.5%). Despite graduating from a course with an integrated research curriculum, participants rarely reflected on research skills (31.5%) and no participant discussed any expertise in clinical topics or knowledge of specific professional services. Responses generally lacked specific skills and skills were spoken about broadly without relating to evidence/experience and were often not targeted to the job description. A proposal for educators aligned with competency standards was also developed based on the findings.Conclusion: Preregistrant pharmacists perceive experience within the workforce and communication and collaboration as the most desired by employers for entry-level pharmacy positions. Education and research competencies were seen as least useful to the job. There was a disconnect between skills gained in university and translation to practice. Academics could enhance the better preregistrant pharmacists' reflection of the skills and competencies they have developed employability by (1) providing portfolio management from the beginning of the course that collects evidence and maps to competencies; (2) integrating learning opportunities across all competencies; and (3) regular skills coaching/mentoring from practicing pharmacists to ensure students are aware of current needs in the job market.

J	Zhang, DT; Tang, P				Zhang, Ditian; Tang, Pan			Forecasting European Union allowances futures: The role of technical indicators	ENERGY			English	Article						European Union allowances; Technical indicators; Out-of-sample forecasts; Ensemble learning; Asset allocation	EQUITY PREMIUM; OIL PRICES; SAMPLE	With the aim of studying the prognostic power of monthly European Carbon futures prices, we employ a wide variety of potential forecasting indicators, including economic variables like uncertainty indicators, energy prices, and stock index data, in addition to exploring the influence of technical indicators on forecasting for the first time. In both in-sample and out-of-sample results, technical indicators display statistically significant ability, exceeding that of economic variables. To gain valuable insight into which indicators are comparatively relevant to the price of EUAs, three types of forecasting methods: univariate predictive regression, dimension-ality reduction techniques, and ensemble learning algorithms are applied. Results show that the first diffusion index in the principal component regression and partial least squares model is greatly influenced by the changes of technical indicators, while only having a weak association with economic variables. With respect to ensemble learning algorithms like Xgboost, greater importance is given to technical indicators compared to economic variables when making predictions. Furthermore, technical indicators demonstrate stable economic value to investors in the form of positive CER gains. Our findings present novel evidence for the predictive capacity of technical indicators and can assist policymakers in formulating sustainable and effective energy policies.

Information Choice, Uncertainty, and Expected Returns	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article							CROSS-SECTION; PORTFOLIO CHOICE; PRICE VOLATILITY; STOCK RETURNS; ATTENTION; BEHAVIOR; RISK; ALLOCATION; EARNINGS; EQUILIBRIUM	We investigate how information choices affect equity returns and risk. Building on an existing theoretical model of information and investment choice, we estimate a learning index that reflects the expected benefits of learning about an asset. High learning index stocks have lower future returns and risk compared to low learning index stocks. Analysis of a conditional asset pricing model, long-run patterns in returns and volatilities, other measures of information flow, and the information environment surrounding earnings announcements reinforce our interpretation of the learning index. Our findings support the model's predictions and illustrate a novel empirical measure of investor learning.

In environments with hidden state variables, forecast-model misspecification can break the link between indeterminacy and sunspots by establishing the existence of "statistical sunspots" in models that have a unique rational expectations equilibrium. To form expectations, agents regress on a set of observables that can include serially correlated nonfundamental factors (e.g., sunspots, judgment, expectations shocks, etc.). In equilibrium, agents attribute, in a self-fulfilling way, some of the serial correlation observed in data to extrinsic noise, i.e., statistical sunspots. This leads to sunspot equilibria in models with a unique rational expectations equilibrium. Unlike many rational sunspots, these equilibria are found to be generically stable under learning. Applications are developed in the context of a New Keynesian and an asset-pricing model.

The nonlinear existence test results show that the time series of soybean futures have multifractal dynamics, long-range dependence, self similarity, and chaos characteristics. This also provides a basis for the construction of a CANN model. Compared with the artificial neural network (ANN) structure as our benchmark system, the predictability of CANN is much higher. The ANN is based on Gaussian kernel function and is only suitable for local approximation of nonstationary signals, so it cannot approach the global nonlinear chaotical hidden pattern. Improving the prediction accuracy of soybean futures prices is of great significance for investors, soybean producers, and decision makers.

In financial markets, stocks of emission (carbon-intensive) firms underperform clean (low-emission) stocks when investor climate sentiment is more positive. We document investors overreaction to climate change risk and reversal in longer horizons. Salient but uninformative climate change events, such as the release of a report on climate change and abnormal weather events, facilitate the investor learning process and correction of the mispricing.

A trading strategy that buys futures with positive RNSK and sells futures with negative RNSK generates a significant excess return. Unlike traditional commodity risk factors' signals, the positive return generated from the RNSK signal is more pronounced in the contango phase. After controlling traditional commodity risk factors, the RNSK signal exhibits a more stable and prolonged predictive ability. The directional-learning hypothesis explains the RNSK impact when commodity futures show higher idiosyncratic risks and illiquidity (positive RNSK) and overpriced (negative RNSK).

A., and C. H. Hommes. 1998. "Heterogeneous Beliefs and Routes to Chaos in a Simple Asset Pricing Model." Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 22 (8): 1235-74). By polluting the information landscape, fake news interferes with agents' perception of the dividend process of the risky asset. Our analysis reveals that fake news decreases the steady-state price of the risky asset by making it even more risky. Moreover, fake news increases the market share of agents who use the destabilizing technical trading rule by rendering fundamental trading more difficult and costly. Instead of converging toward its steady state, the risky asset's price may thus be subject to wild fluctuations. As it turns out, these fluctuations are concentrated below the risky asset's steady-state price. We also show that fake news campaigns may allow certain agents to realize fraudulent profits.

J	Anufriev, M; Chernulich, A; Tuinstra, J				Anufriev, Mikhail; Chernulich, Aleksei; Tuinstra, Jan			Asset price volatility and investment horizons: An experimental investigation	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Experimental economics; Expectations; Asset pricing; Investment horizons; Behavioral finance	EXPECTATIONS; BUBBLES; MOMENTUM; RISK	We study the effects of the investment horizon on asset price volatility using a Learning to Forecast laboratory experiment. We find that, for short investment horizons, participants coordinate on self-fulfilling trend-extrapolating predictions. Price deviations are then re-inforced and amplified, possibly leading to large bubbles and crashes in asset prices. For longer investment horizons such bubbles do not emerge and price volatility tends to be lower. This is due to the fact that, for longer horizons, there is more dispersion in partic-ipants' forecasts, and participants extrapolate trends in past prices to a lesser extent. We also show that, independent of the investment horizon, if the initial history of asset prices is already relatively stable before participants start their prediction task, price volatility remains small, with prices close to their fundamental values for the duration of the exper-iment.

J	Liang, CYC; Zhang, RG				Liang, Claire Y. C.; Zhang, Rengong			Post-earnings announcement drift and parameter uncertainty: evidence from industry and market news	REVIEW OF QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article						Post-earnings announcement drift; Earnings momentum; Anomaly; Parameter uncertainty; Rational learning	INFORMATION UNCERTAINTY; FORECAST ACCURACY; STOCK RETURNS; CROSS-SECTION; INVESTOR; RISK; ANALYST; EQUILIBRIUM; EFFICIENCY; SURPRISES	Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD), one of the most prominent and robust return anomalies, is often attributed to investor naivete or irrationality. A competing explanation is parameter uncertainty, which posits that PEAD may occur as rational investors encounter parameter uncertainty and must learn about the true values of a firm's pricing parameters over time. This study extends the parameter uncertainty explanation for PEAD and hypothesizes that industry or market news arriving during the drift period affects drift strength. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the prices of high surprise firms show stronger responses to industry/market news in the drift period. Hence, the drift becomes stronger (weaker or reversed) when drift-period industry/market news agrees (disagrees) with a firm's prior earnings news. The evidence helps to distinguish the parameter uncertainty theory from competing behavioral explanations based on investor naivete or irrational biases, a task previous studies find difficult. Overall, our findings indicate that asset pricing anomalies need not imply investor irrationality-anomalies could arise from rational investors learning about pricing parameters over time.

Many food and agricultural innovations are being developed and scaled but these innovations often target sector-specific problems and remain disconnected from the more complex demand for transformative change at scale. To bridge this demand for systemic change within the innovation ecosystem, initiatives are applying various approaches such as visioning, holistic assessments, innovation portfolio management and multistakeholder co-creation. Here we report on insights from applying a food systems tailored backcasting approach in a diversity of settings since 2021, including a national food system dialogue, a youth business innovation challenge, a landscape multi-stakeholder platform, a public-private sector co-learning session, an agroecological transitions program, and a hybrid food systems university course for graduate students and global professionals. We thereby build on existing literature and case studies of how change happens (or does not happen) and aim to use those insights to support food systems change makers. Across these settings, the backcasting approach asks participants to connect innovations with broader systems-change visions, to anticipate tradeoffs for multiple food system outcomes and population groups, and to cross sectoral boundaries. The use cases demonstrate that the backcasting process contributes to changes in views, practices and structures that participants work with. Specifically, it supports moving beyond "silver bullet" innovation approaches, the bundling of social and technical innovations, and building action-oriented cross-sectoral bridges. Food systems change is complex and innovations alone are insufficient to address its complexity. But innovations can play a positive role if connected to more holistic systems-change processes and goals. Considering strengths and limitations of the backcasting approach, the diversity of practical applications supports its potential to connect innovations to holistic food systems visions, to strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration and to bundle social and technical innovations for desirable food systems change.

We contrast the behavior of a manager who may invest her personal wealth in a private account to a manager who is either forced to commit her wealth to the fund she manages or not allowed to hold risky assets held by the fund privately. We show that a fund managed by a manager with higher ability does not necessarily achieve higher expected returns but achieves lower idiosyncratic volatility. For a manager with constant ability, restrictions placed on her personal account do not influence her choices in the fund, while for a manager whose ability varies stochastically, they result in higher expected returns and idiosyncratic volatilities. Fund strategies can be nonmonotone both in the manager's commitment level and the ratio of manager to investor wealth. Our results are robust to incomplete information and to competing managers with correlated ability.

As a significant participant, China is leveraging its government -led environmental regulation (ER) system, which has a multilevel and multi-sectoral structure, to effectively combat climate change. However, the effect of this ER system, especially collaborative efforts among multiple government subjects, on CER remains unknown. Thus, this paper is the first attempt to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of multi -government ER synergy on CER from the perspective of government subject synergy. Using a dataset of Chinese A -share listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2021, this study finds the following. First, multi -government ER synergy boosts CER. Direct ER synergy, stemming from joint policy -making across departments, encourages CER in end -of -pipe governance. Indirect ER synergy, arising from administrative hierarchy constraints among multi -level governments, fosters CER in front-end governance. Second, financing constraints and executives ' attention to CER are two key channels through which multi -government ER synergy influences CER. Third, firms with political connections, those in heavily polluting industries, or those located in central and western regions adopt more proactive CER strategies under multi -government ER synergy. This paper expands research on government collaborative governance from the regional macro -perspective to the micro -firm level, providing valuable insights for countries worldwide, particularly emerging economies that share similar characteristics with China, to contain rapidly growing environmental challenges and advance global sustainability.

J	Sabbaghi, O; Xu, M				Sabbaghi, Omid; Xu, Min			Is there persistence among non-professionals? Evidence from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group Trading Challenges	REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE			English	Article						Learning; Asset pricing; Evolution; Financial time series; Persistence; D83; G12; G14	MUTUAL FUND PERFORMANCE; SHORT-RUN PERSISTENCE; RISK; EXPECTATIONS; RETURNS; BUSINESS; BEHAVIOR; WINNERS	Purpose The study systematically investigates persistence in performance for simulated trading among non-professional traders in the futures market. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors employ a novel data set from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group's Trading Challenges for years 2014 through 2018 and expand upon the empirical methodology of Malkiel (1995) through improved interval estimations in testing for persistence in performance. The authors implement Fama-MacBeth style regressions to understand the degree of persistence in performance and the extent to which non-professionals extrapolate from prior returns. They adjust returns for risk through the Fama and French (2015) five-factor model in understanding whether the sample of non-professionals is able to produce excess returns after expenses and whether there is evidence of excess gross to cover expenses. Findings The empirical analysis suggests strong evidence for performance persistence among non-professionals participating in the Preliminary Rounds. In the Championship Rounds, the authors find that the persistence effect becomes stronger in economic and statistical significance after accounting for expenses. The results suggest that competition and transaction costs help to distinguish between winners and losers. When conducting Fama-MacBeth style regressions, the authors present evidence that strongly supports the persistence effect and over-extrapolation. While the results of the multi-factor model analysis suggest that, after adjusting for risk, most teams are experiencing negative excess returns prior to expenses, the authors also uncover evidence of teams earning returns sufficient to cover their expenses. Originality/value The authors bridge the gap between the literature on performance persistence and the emerging literature on non-professionals in the financial markets. Data from the CME Group's Trading Challenge provide a rich source in studying the beliefs of non-professionals, and this study is helpful for understanding how beliefs, operationalized in simulated trades, perform over short time horizons, thereby providing insights into the behavioral dynamics of the financial markets. The results provide new empirical evidence for performance persistence among non-professionals.

J	LeBaron, B				LeBaron, Blake			Microconsistency in Simple Empirical Agent-Based Financial Models	COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Learning; Heterogeneous agent models; Asset pricing; Financial time series; Adaptive behavior	BEHAVIORAL HETEROGENEITY; DYNAMICS	Models with small numbers of agents have recently been simplified for direct empirical estimation. Parameters are estimated at the macro level to get a best fit to the data. However, little analysis is done at the micro level to examine the choices made by agents for forecasting rules. This paper explores one of these recent models from the standpoint of micro agent behavior. It is shown that at the fitted forecasting rules, agents would prefer deviating to other nearby rules. The simple two type model is then compared with several multi-type models allowing for agents to use a broader set of rules. This can impact the dynamics of the generated time series, but it also may not if one takes the parameter estimates of the original model as an exogenous restriction on a reasonable support for the forecasting rules. This result emphasizes that these models may be imposing some hidden micro assumptions about agent behavior.

Specifically, the crash risk effects are stronger for stocks with higher institutional ownership, and the institutional ownership effect plays less of a role on stock returns among stocks with higher crash risk. Furthermore, this paper addresses the moderating effect of stock liquidity on the relation among institutional investors, crash risk and stock returns, and further finds that illiquidity-return relations are stronger in situations with lower crash risk. Overall, this paper does provide evidence that institutional investors and crash risk play important roles on stock prices.

J	Zhang, C; Zhao, S				Zhang, Chu; Zhao, Shen			The macroeconomic announcement premium and information environment	JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Macroeconomic news; Announcement premium; Risk reduction; Information quality; Business cycles	EQUITY PREMIUM; RISK-AVERSION; COMBINATION FORECASTS; POLICY UNCERTAINTY; LABOR MARGIN; STOCK; NEWS; EXPECTATIONS; EQUILIBRIUM; RETURNS	The quality of information environment has impact on the market risk premium and the expected risk reduction on macroeconomic announcement days. The risk premium is high when the risk is high as in standard asset pricing models, while the risk premium is low when the prevailing information environment is poor. The same is true for the expected risk reduction. These effects extend to market factor premiums (i.e., the premium associated with market betas) on various sets of portfolios and have a connection with business cycles. The findings are consistent with the notion that poor information environment hampers the effectiveness of learning.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LEADERSHIP IN APPLICATION AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS			Russian	Article						leadership; flexible methodology of management; project; competency; pattern of behavior; project manager		The development of project, project and portfolio management systems supports the global acceleration of innovation. Significant changes in the environment require additional research on the effectiveness of the use of existing flexible methodologies, knowledge systems, the competency of project managers and their leadership. The foundation of environmental change lies in changing the decision-making paradigm to flexible project management and innovation development programs. The article examines modern approaches to leadership formation in the application of flexible methodologies, their specificity in terms of decision-making processes in project management. The problems of formation and maintenance of leadership in application of flexible methodologies of project management of creation and introduction of information and communication systems are considered. The research was conducted on the basis of the application of a competency approach under the model of the International Association for Project Management. The patterns of behavior of flexible leaders and leaders are formed in the system of behavioral competencies in project management based on Agile technology methods and tools. These competencies were: Self-reflation and self-government, Personal integrity and reliability, Personal communication, Relationships and interaction, Leadership, Teamwork, Conflicts and crises, Inventiveness, Harmonization, and Orientation to the result. The content model of competency of the leader, which applies flexible control, is given. The patterns of behavior of project managers as flexible leaders in project product creation and flexible project management were studied. Differences in patterns of behavior of managers and flexible leaders on elements of behavioral competencies within certain key competency indicators are studied. Such patterns allowed the authors to identify bottlenecks in applying flexible project management methodologies in the context of the dynamics of the development of innovative products and information and communication systems.

Discount-rate news is more important than cash-flow news in determining the conditional variance of the market return in recessions, while the opposite holds true in expansions. In an asset pricing model with regime-switching fundamentals, the fact that discount-rate news is more sensitive to changes in investors' beliefs about the state of the economy, which are more volatile in recessions, provides a potential explanation.

J	Oshima, K				Oshima, Katsuhiro			Heterogeneous beliefs, monetary policy, and stock price volatility	ANNALS OF FINANCE			English	Article						Stock price; Asset pricing; Heterogeneity; Subjective belief; Monetary policy; New Keynesian	GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM; BUSINESS-CYCLE; MARKET; DYNAMICS; MODELS; SHOCKS	In this paper, I build a two-agent New Keynesian model in which households with subjective and objective beliefs about capital gains from stock prices exist. The former type of households constructs their beliefs about expected capital gains by Bayesian learning from observed growth rates of stock prices. In a homogenous agent model with only subjective beliefs, the effect of the interest rate on stock prices tends to be unrealistically strong. I show how the presence of heterogeneity improves second moments of stock prices with realistic moments of business cycle properties. This quantitative improvement in stock price behaviors allows me to conduct a realistic analysis of how the stance of monetary policy affects stock price volatilities. Strong inertia of monetary policy provides the stability of stock prices. This is because the near-term real interest rate has dominant effects on stock prices under the presence of subjective beliefs since the presence limits the forward-looking nature in pricing stocks. However, because output depends on the expected path of the real interest rate in the forward-looking manner, strong monetary policy inertia does not necessarily provide stabilities of stock prices and output at the same time.

J	Zhang, TB				Zhang, Tongbin			Stock prices and the risk-free rate: An internal rationality approach	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL			English	Article						Stock prices; Risk-free rate; Internal rationality learning; Correlation; Variance decomposition	LONG-RUN; MONETARY-POLICY; VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION; TERM STRUCTURE; ASSET; MODEL; BUBBLES; BOND; EXPLANATION; RETURNS	The co-movement of stock prices and the risk-free rate in the United States is weak in terms of the correlation and variance decomposition. It is essential for investors and policymakers to understand such co-movement, especially when several well-known asset pricing models imply a much stronger relationship than the one empirically observed. To explain this inconsistency, this paper presents a model with "internally rational" agents who optimally update their subjective beliefs about stock prices. Compared with the riskfree rate, agents' subjective beliefs are essential for generating stock market volatility. Quantitatively, our model can jointly produce basic asset market facts and the weak comovement. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DEQNs are neural networks trained in an unsupervised fashion to satisfy all equilibrium conditions along simulated paths of the economy. Since DEQNs approximate the equilibrium functions directly, simulating the economy is computationally cheap, and training data can be generated at virtually zero cost. We demonstrate that DEQNs can accurately solve economically relevant models by applying them to two challenging life-cycle models and a Bewley-style model with aggregate risk.

J	Mesly, O; Mavoori, H				Mesly, Olivier; Mavoori, Hareesh			Mapping borrowers' and lenders' interactions according to their dark financial profiles	JOURNAL OF MARKETING ANALYTICS			English	Article; Early Access						Borrowers; Combinatorics; Dark financial profile; Deceit; Disconnection; Eutectic; Irrationality; Learning; Lenders; G41; M21; M31	SELF-CONTROL; MISREPRESENTATION; EQUILIBRIUM; COEVOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; AMYGDALA; FAILURE; CRISIS; SYSTEM	In this interdisciplinary, conceptual article with implications in marketing financial products and services, we study real estate and capital markets characterized by a predatory paradigm and economic agents' dark financial profiles (DFPs). These are estimated by three orthogonal components-disconnection, irrationality, and deceit. We identify the best interactional patterns of borrower-lender profiles, ones that expectedly minimize the risk of default. We resort to discretized, predator-prey Lotka-Volterra equations where lenders act as predators and borrowers as prey, incorporating market trends and learning effects. To mathematically operationalize our framework, we use combinatorics with high, medium, and low levels of the three components of DFPs. We find 27 salient lender-borrower interactional scenarios and observe three different patterns: explosive, conducive, and implosive. Our theoretical findings indicate that equal (ir)rationality (in financial terms) between lenders and borrowers is a necessary but insufficient condition to maintain harmonious, long-term relationships. We use eutectic theory to map the agents' profiles by introducing another variable: Expected return [E(Rp)] versus risk [sigma], using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as a base. We find six market segments: the inactive predators and prey, the loose, the greedy, the vulnerable, and the stable. We identify the optimal combination of borrowers-lenders interaction under risk, given market trends and learning effects. We propose a path for future research that would see the application of analytical tools such as factor analysis, k-means clustering algorithm, chi 2 and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison tests to verify differences among the hypothesized segments.

J	Zhao, JS; Zhang, C; Wu, Y; Zhu, J				Zhao, Jingsong; Zhang, Chen; Wu, Yong; Zhu, Jing			Dual driving forces for corporate environmental responsibility performance: The synergistic effects of government environmental regulation and market multi-agent green supervision	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Government environmental regulation; Market multi-agent green supervision; Synergy; Corporate environmental responsibility; performance	STRATEGY	The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference reached a series of agreements on implementing the Paris Agreement, empowering governments to independently establish emission reduction goals and encouraging market participants to invest in sustainable development. It highlighted that enhancing corporate environmental responsibility performance (CERP), driven by the collaborative efforts of government and market forces, is key to achieving global sustainability. In this context, this study is the first attempt to investigate the synergistic effects of government environmental regulation (GER) and market multi-agent green supervision (MGS) on CERP. The findings are as follows. First, GER, encompassing the multidimensional environmental responsibilities of governments, has not effectively spurred CERP. MGS, incorporating the green concerns of diverse investors and intermediaries, serves as a significant catalyst for enhancing CERP. The synergy between GER and MGS, involving multi-stakeholder collaborative governance, plays a significant motivating role in promoting CERP. Second, financing constraints and executives' attention to corporate environmental responsibility (CER) are two key channels through which the synergy between GER and MGS influences CERP. Third, firms located in regions with better economic development, those operating in non-heavily polluting industries, or non-state-owned firms exhibit heightened proactivity in improving CERP under the synergy between GER and MGS.

J	Bianchi, F; Ludvigson, SC; Ma, S				Bianchi, Francesco; Ludvigson, Sydney C.; Ma, Sai			Belief Distortions and Macroeconomic Fluctuationst	AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article							EXPECTATIONS; RISK; INFORMATION; US; AMBIGUITY; FORECASTS; VARIABLES; RETURNS; SHOCKS; MODEL	This paper combines a data-rich environment with a machine learning algorithm to provide new estimates of time-varying systematic expectational errors (" belief distortions") embedded in survey responses. We find sizable distortions even for professional forecasters, with all respondent-types overweighting the implicit judgmental component of their forecasts relative to what can be learned from publicly available information. Forecasts of inflation and GDP growth oscillate between optimism and pessimism by large margins, with belief distortions evolving dynamically in response to cyclical shocks. The results suggest that artificial intelligence algorithms can be productively deployed to correct errors in human judgment and improve predictive accuracy.

Therefore, this study investigates whether formal credit promotes entrepreneurial farmers' e-commerce utilization and explores its influencing mechanism. Based on the survey data collected from 831 entrepreneurial farmers in Shaanxi province, Ningxia province and Shandong province in rural China, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was applied to measure the impact of formal credit on e-commerce utilization. The results show that formal credit contributes to a 18.41% increase of e-commerce utilization in general and increases entrepreneurial farmers' online purchases and sales by 11.15% and 14.69%, respectively. Some groups perform significantly in the heterogeneity analysis, the most noteworthy of which are entrepreneurial farmers who are younger, belong to new type of agricultural business entities and use mobile payments. Their e-commerce utilization, including online purchases and sales, are impacted most by formal credit. Furthermore, when the bootstrap method was used to examine the mediating effect, we found that formal credit has a positive and significant effect on the utilization of e-commerce through four channels, which are internet learning, asset allocation, labor allocation and income growth. Hence, the findings suggest that the government should augment the amount of formal credit to optimize entrepreneurial farmers' internet learning, asset allocation, labor employment and income growth, thereby promoting e-commerce to achieve entrepreneurial transformation and sustainable development in rural areas.

We capture this feature using return dynamics driven by both a transitory and a permanent component. We study the asset allocation and portfolio performance when transitory and permanent components cannot be observed and therefore need to be estimated. Strategies that account for the observed timing of equity risk outperform those that do not, particularly so out of sample. Indeed, the mean (median) certainty equivalent return increases from about 13% (12%) to about 21% (15%) because properly modeling the timing of equity risk implies surges in portfolio returns.

J	Nystrup, P; Lindström, E; Madsen, H				Nystrup, Peter; Lindstrom, Erik; Madsen, Henrik			Learning hidden Markov models with persistent states by penalizing jumps	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time series analysis; Clustering; Unsupervised learning; Regime switching; Regularization; Dynamic programming	FINANCIAL TIME-SERIES; ASSET ALLOCATION; STYLIZED FACTS; SEGMENTATION; LIKELIHOOD; MARKETS; EM	Hidden Markov models are applied in many expert and intelligent systems to detect an underlying sequence of persistent states. When the model is misspecified or misestimated, however, it often leads to unrealistically rapid switching dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel estimation approach based on clustering temporal features while penalizing jumps. We compare the approach to spectral clustering and the standard approach of maximizing the likelihood function in an extensive simulation study and an application to financial data. The advantages of the proposed jump estimator include that it learns the hidden state sequence and model parameters simultaneously and faster while providing control over the transition rate, it is less sensitive to initialization, it performs better when the number of states increases, and it is robust to misspecified conditional distributions. The value of estimating the true persistence of the state process is illustrated through a simple trading strategy where improved estimates result in much lower transaction costs. Robustness is particularly critical when the model is part of a system used in production. Therefore, our proposed estimator significantly improves the potential for using hidden Markov models in practical applications. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adding inflation as a second variable, we uncover two states in which expected consumption growth is low, one with high and one with negative expected inflation. Embedded in a general equilibrium asset pricing model with learning, these dynamics replicate the observed time variation in stock return volatilities and stock-bond return correlations. They also provide an alternative derivation for a measure of time-varying disaster risk suggested by Watcher [Wachter J (2013) Can time-varying risk of rare disasters explain aggregate stock market volatility? J. Finance 68(3):987-1035]. implying that both the disaster and the long-run risk paradigm can be extended toward explaining movements in the stock-bond correlation.

ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Declarative carbon disclosure; Interactive carbon disclosure; Firm value; Topic modeling; Sentiment analysis; Complementary effect; Substitution effect	INFORMATION ASYMMETRY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CAPITAL-MARKETS; DISSEMINATION; ATTENTION; COST	The intrinsic link between carbon disclosure and firm value deserves in-depth study in light of the global proposal for "carbon neutrality" and the concurrent advancement of both declarative and interactive carbon disclosure practices. Extant research on separate value effects of declarative and interactive carbon disclosure is inconsistent with their simultaneous development. This paper reveals the heterogeneous value effects of declarative and interactive carbon disclosure in terms of information asymmetry and reputation and explores their intertwined value effects according to their characteristics and efficient market hypothesis, which is the first to consider both declarative and interactive carbon disclosure when examining the impact of carbon disclosure on firm value. In terms of methodology, a metric for assessing the quality of interactive carbon disclosure has been created. Using data from Chinese A-share listed firms from 2015 to 2021, we find that declarative carbon disclosure promotes firm value by alleviating information asymmetry and improving the firm reputation. Poor interactive carbon disclosure exacerbates information asymmetry, damages the firm reputation, and thus declines firm value, while high-quality one can alleviate information asymmetry and help firms gain word-of-mouth, thus enhancing firm value. Declarative and interactive carbon disclosure are substitutes for improving firm value. Heterogeneity analysis finds that high-quality interactive carbon disclosure containing positive carbon information and firms' business layouts can improve firm value. The results are beneficial to firms to synergize the use of multiple carbon disclosure methods to enhance firm value.

Empirical evidence is elusive despite forty years of intensive academic research. The conjecture is also resoundingly refuted by the late 1990s' dotcom bubble featured by sharp increases in both market prices and variance. Gao and Martin (2021), Lochstoer and Muir (2021), and Nagel and Xu (2021) interpret empirical findings as evidence of irrational expectations. Ai, Han, and Xu (2021) attribute the weak or negative risk-return relation to learning about economic fundamentals with imperfect signals. Guo, Lin, and Pai (2021) argue for two types of fundamental variance that have opposite effects on conditional equity premium and market prices. More research is needed to explain the risk-return relation puzzle prevalent in both U.S. and Asia-Pacific markets.

J	Yu, Z; Wang, MD; Wei, XD; Lou, J				Yu, Zhen; Wang, Michael D.; Wei, Xiangdong; Lou, Jie			News Credibility and Influence within the Financial Markets	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE			English	Article						News; Media; Behavioral finance; Cryptocurrency valuation	SENTIMENT; NOISE; FEEDBACK; CONTEXT; PRICES; RISK	How does information credibility, a subjective judgment of investors, affect empirical asset pricing in financial markets? Traditional economic theories are inadequate for interpreting market responses driven by people's subjective thinking, as these cognitive processes are not encompassed by the concept of utility. We explore these effects by using computational linguistics and deep structured learning algorithms to analyze financial newspapers and social media posts. After controlling for factors related to content and market momentum in our narrative based credibility indicator, we find that news credibility is positively correlated with the returns on assets preferred by experts and negatively correlated with assets preferred by gamblers. Based on this finding, we point out that the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is not appropriate in the dominant market of gamblers in the short-term. In the long-term, however, investment motivation does not significantly affect the validity of the hypothesis.

J	Garvey, G; Madhavan, A				Garvey, Gerald; Madhavan, Ananth			Rethinking Emerging Markets: A Fresh Perspective	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The standard classification of emerging markets (EMs) does not correspond well to stage of development, wealth, culture, or industrial mix. The authors propose using unsupervised learning to group country stock markets across countries based on similarity of returns. The authors find that EMs contain two distinct groups reflecting Asian manufacturing and commodity exposure. This heterogeneity provides diversification to index investors and allocation opportunities to active investors. China is on the edge between the two groups, consistent with it being a key manufacturer and a major driver of commodities. The authors argue for retaining the existing EM classification and treating China as a separate entity.

Forecast density combinations of dynamic models and data driven portfolio strategies	JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Seminar on Bayesian Econometrics (ESOBE)	OCT, 2015	Study Center Gerzensee, Gerzensee, SWITZERLAND		Study Center Gerzensee	Forecast combination; Momentum strategy; Filtering methods; Bayes estimates	HIERARCHICAL MIXTURES; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; CROSS-SECTION; EFFICIENT; SELECTION; EXPERTS; ALGORITHMS; SIMULATION; RETURNS	A dynamic asset-allocation model is specified in probabilistic terms as a combination of return distributions resulting from multiple pairs of dynamic models and portfolio strategies based on momentum patterns in US industry returns. The nonlinear state space representation of the model allows efficient and robust simulation-based Bayesian inference using a novel non-linear filter. Combination weights can be cross-correlated and correlated over time using feedback mechanisms. Diagnostic analysis gives insight into model and strategy misspecification. Empirical results show that a smaller flexible model-strategy combination performs better in terms of expected return and risk than a larger basic model-strategy combination. Dynamic patterns in combination weights and diagnostic learning provide useful signals for improved modeling and policy, in particular, from a risk-management perspective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, P; Shen, Y; Zhang, L; Kang, YX				Wang, Pei; Shen, Yang; Zhang, Ling; Kang, Yuxin			Equilibrium investment strategy for a DC pension plan with learning about stock return predictability	INSURANCE MATHEMATICS & ECONOMICS			English	Article						Dynamic equilibrium; DC pension plan; Return predictability; Learning; Filtering technique	VARIANCE PORTFOLIO SELECTION; STOCHASTIC INTEREST-RATES; OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT; ASSET ALLOCATION; OPTIMIZATION; SCHEMES; CHOICE; INCOME	This paper investigates a time-consistent investment strategy under the mean-variance criterion for an investor who accumulates retirement savings through a defined contribution (DC) pension plan with stock and bond investment opportunities. The expected return rate on the stock is modulated by an unobservable predictor which follows a mean-reverting stochastic process. The evolution of the instantaneous interest rate is described by the Vasicek model. In addition, the contribution rate of the DC pension plan is stochastic and correlated with financial risks coming from the stochastic interest rate and stock price. In a game theoretic framework, we derive a closed-form equilibrium investment strategy and corresponding equilibrium value function for the mean-variance criterion by adopting the filtering technique and the stochastic control method. Furthermore, we provide an equilibrium investment strategy and equilibrium value function when the expected return rate of the stock is completely observable. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium investment strategy and equilibrium efficient frontier. Numerical analysis confirms that there is nonnegligible information loss on the equilibrium investment strategy and equilibrium value function due to partial observation in the stock price dynamics.

J	Hu, S; Zhang, C; Ji, YP; Zhang, C				Hu, Shu; Zhang, Chen; Ji, Yuanpu; Zhang, Chao			Does environmental information disclosure tone affect corporate green innovation in China? Based on the institutional perspective	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Environmental information disclosure tone; Tone dispersion; Corporate green innovation; Government supervision; Media attention; Executive environmental cognition; Institutional theory; Behavioral finance theory	PRODUCT INNOVATION; TEXTUAL ANALYSIS; FIRM VALUE; MEDIA; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; STAKEHOLDERS; READABILITY; GOVERNANCE; COMPANIES	As a vital channel for enterprises to convey corporate environmental responsibility, the information validity and textual features of environmental disclosure are increasingly concerned. From a new perspective of textual tone, we explore the impact of environmental information disclosure tone on corporate green innovation based on the sample of Chinese A-share listed manufacturing enterprises from 2010 to 2020 and future analyze the different functions of regulative, normative, and cognitive institutional factors. Applying text mining and Poisson regression models, we find that the net positive tone of environmental information and its degree of dispersion can enhance information transparency, improve stakeholders' positive expectations, and have positive information and resource effects on corporate green innovation. And the concentrated negative tone could alleviate negative reactions. Furthermore, the results indicate that under external pressures of the regulative institution of government supervision and the normative institution of media attention, the signaling role of information tone is enhanced, while the cognitive institution of executive environmental cognition exerts an inhibitory effect. Additional analyses suggest that the effect of environmental disclosure tone on green innovation is more pronounced in enterprises that are non-state-owned, lightly polluted, and located in economically developed areas. Information readability also plays a reinforcing role. This paper substantiates the signal function of environmental information intonation, which enriches the study of the language features of non-financial information and has implications for the perfection of environmental institutions.

J	Babiak, M				Babiak, Mykola			Generalized Disappointment Aversion and the Variance Term Structure	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS			English	Article							LONG-RUN; EQUITY PREMIUM; RARE DISASTERS; RISK-AVERSION; EQUILIBRIUM; CONSUMPTION; RETURNS; EXPECTATIONS; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR	Contrary to leading asset pricing theories, recent empirical evidence indicates that financial markets compensate only short-term equity variance risk. An equilibrium model with generalized disappointment aversion risk preferences and rare events reconciles salient features of the variance term structure. In addition, a calibration explains the variance and skew risk premiums in equity returns and the implied volatility skew of index options while capturing standard moments of fundamentals, equity returns, and the risk-free rate. The key intuition for the results stems from substantial countercyclical risk aversion induced by endogenous variation in the probability of disappointing events in consumption growth.

J	Olante, ME; Lassini, U				Olante, Maria Elena; Lassini, Ugo			Investment property: Fair value or cost model? Recent evidence from the application of IAS 40 in Europe	ADVANCES IN ACCOUNTING			English	Article						M41; Investment property; IAS 40; Fair value; Accounting choice	ACCOUNTING METHOD CHOICE; INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES; ASSET REVALUATIONS; INFORMATION; MARKET; CONSERVATISM; RECOGNITION; COUNTRY; PRICES	The purpose of this study is to shed light on the management choice between fair value and cost for investment property under IAS 40 in Europe. Using a multi-motivation approach, we explore what drives this choice across countries and across industries after ten years have passed from the first adoption of IAS 40. Following the theoretical framework developed by the accounting choice theory, we hypothesize that there are several classes of reasons possibly leading managers to commit to fair value: contractual efficiency motives, asset pricing incentives tied to information asymmetries, country institutional factors, and industry factors. In order to test these hypotheses, we select a sample of publicly-traded firms operating in the real estate, manufacturing and banking industries, and located in nine European countries where national pre-IFRS standards mandated either fair value or historical cost for investment property. We test our hypotheses running our model both on the full sample (real estate, manufacturing, and banking) and on a subsample that excludes real estate firms. We find that all the proposed rationales included in our model play a role in explaining the choice between fair value and cost. Particularly, with regard to asset pricing incentives, the ratio of market to book value, as a proxy for information asymmetries, has a negative association with fair value. As for contractual motives, firm size, as a proxy for political costs is negatively related with the choice of fair value, although the firm's reliance on debt (measured by leverage) seems not to affect the choice. Firms with a higher ratio of investment property over total assets are much more likely to opt for fair value than firms for which IAS 40 assets are less significant. Finally, the comparison of choices made by firms in our sample at the first adoption of IFRS in 2005 with those made after ten years provides evidence of a learning process. The fair value choice however appears to be strongly related to country institutional factors, particularly the development of capital markets and legal origin, with firms operating in countries where markets are more developed being more likely to choose fair value.

J	Mroua, M; Souissi, N; Donia, M				Mroua, Mourad; Souissi, Nada; Donia, Mrabet			Dependency and causal relationship between 'Bitcoin' and financial asset classes: A Bayesian network approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Bayesian network; Bitcoin; conventional markets; GARCH model; Markov switching; parametric and structure learning	GOLD; VOLATILITY	This study employs the Bayesian Networks (BN) and the wavelet coherence approaches to invest the relationship between Bitcoin volatility and financial asset classes (MSCI world equity index, S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index [GSCI], US index and Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index ETF [PIMCO]) using daily data for the period from August 2011 to October 2021. The results show that the causal relationship between Bitcoin and other financial assets varies depending on the market states. During the low volatility periods, Bitcoin has a stronger impact on the GSCI, while during the stability periods, it has a direct effect on the US index and the MSCI world index. In contrast, during high volatility periods, Bitcoin has a direct impact on both the GSCI and PIMCO indices. The key findings enabled us to provide implications for US investors to promote asset allocation and risk management covering both Bitcoin and traditional financial markets. The results suggest that policymakers should watch Botcoin closely to preserve financial stability.

A sparse regression and neural network approach for financial factor modeling	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Finance; Factor model construction; Best subset selection; Neural networks; Interpretability-accuracy trade-off	SELECTION; EQUILIBRIUM; RETURNS	Factor models are central to understanding risk-return trade-offs in finance. Since Fama and French (1993), hundreds of factors have been found to have explanatory power for asset pricing. To construct a factor model, two tasks have to be performed: Feature Selection, selecting a small subset given a large number of factors to overcome overfitting in regression, and Feature Engineering, determining the interactions between the factors. In this work, the process of constructing factor models (not the factors themselves) is examined. A unified, two-step process of dimensionality reduction and nonlinear transformation that produces parsimonious, general factor models is proposed. Comparisons between frameworks implementing linear feature selection models as well as non-linear feature reduction techniques are conducted. A second stage generalizes the models by learning nonlinear interactions. The framework attempts to strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability. Results of computational experiments on historical financial data, on three models of varying degrees of nonlinearity and interpretability suggest that mixed-integer-programming-based formulations are suitable for the task of linear financial factor selection and that the second-stage nonlinearity due to neural networks improves accuracy.

We analyze the persistency of this difference in a setting in which investors are faced with multiple decisions over time and are consequently able to adjust the risk level they initially chose. For this we use an experimental setting with repeated investment decisions over multiple trading days, and we also test a new form of risk simulation in which wealth paths over time are presented rather than just final outcomes. After investors' initial decisions, for which we confirm previous findings, we do not find persistent differences of simulation-based learning on investors' risk-taking behavior. With regards to trading volume, only a simulation in which investors see wealth paths and not only final outcomes leads to lower trading frequency soon after the initial asset allocation.

An energy retrofit of this building stock is needed to meet the current European goals on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The retrofit is also needed in order to guarantee adequate comfort levels in indoor spaces and good conditions for learning and educational activities, that are often not reached in poor quality constructions. This work presents the results of an interdisciplinary study related to the energy requalification of a school located in Ostia, near Rome in Italy, built in the 1960s with a steel structure and Eternit infill. The scope of the analysis is to verify the economic and environmental effectiveness of four proposed retrofit interventions concerning the replacement of fixtures and the installation of an insulating coat. The current thermal transmittance of the walls was evaluated through thermofluximetric measurements conducted in situ; dynamic simulations were performed to determine the current energy performance and the energy performances following the four proposed retrofit scenarios. Energy and carbon payback times were evaluated (by means of the life cycle analysis (LCA) approach) and the economic value was determined for each of the four proposed retrofits, using a probabilistic approach. The results show that the replacement of windows is the most convenient intervention from all points of view. The study provides evidence that an assessment of schools' energy retrofits should include both economic and life cycle aspects.

Project value focuses on the hard elements of projects that can be expressed in monetary terms. In the petroleum exploration business, however, there is also soft information, like effects on corporate liquidity, advantages of compliance with the strategic goals, or learning potential and organizational development, which may change the ranking hierarchy. The aim of this research is to provide a solution for incorporating industry-based selected soft data in the project ranking process. The process is illustrated with a case study. We took the structured system of criteria identified from the petroleum industry.

J	Shi, LL; Guo, XS; Fenu, A; Wang, BH				Shi, Leilei; Guo, Xinshuai; Fenu, Andrea; Wang, Bing-Hong			The underlying coherent behavior in intraday dynamic market equilibrium	CHINA FINANCE REVIEW INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Complexity economics; Interactively coherent preference; Interactive trader; Momentum and reversal trader; Local equilibrium; BH curve; C60; D01; D90; G10; G40	SOCIAL-INTERACTION; RATIONAL CHOICE; PROSPECT-THEORY; TRADING VOLUME; DEMAND CURVES; STOCK-PRICES; ANOMALIES; INFORMATION; MOMENTUM; RETURNS	PurposeThis paper applies a volume-price probability wave differential equation to propose a conceptual theory and has innovative behavioral interpretations of intraday dynamic market equilibrium price, in which traders' momentum, reversal and interactive behaviors play roles.Design/methodology/approachThe authors select intraday cumulative trading volume distribution over price as revealed preferences. An equilibrium price is a price at which the corresponding cumulative trading volume achieves the maximum value. Based on the existence of the equilibrium in social finance, the authors propose a testable interacting traders' preference hypothesis without imposing the invariance criterion of rational choices. Interactively coherent preferences signify the choices subject to interactive invariance over price.FindingsThe authors find that interactive trading choices generate a constant frequency over price and intraday dynamic market equilibrium in a tug-of-war between momentum and reversal traders. The authors explain the market equilibrium through interactive, momentum and reversal traders. The intelligent interactive trading preferences are coherent and account for local dynamic market equilibrium, holistic dynamic market disequilibrium and the nonlinear and non-monotone V-shaped probability of selling over profit (BH curves).Research limitations/implicationsThe authors will understand investors' behaviors and dynamic markets through more empirical execution in the future, suggesting a unified theory available in social finance.Practical implicationsThe authors can apply the subjects' intelligent behaviors to artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning and financial technology.Social implicationsUnderstanding the behavior of interacting individuals or units will help social risk management beyond the frontiers of the financial market, such as governance in an organization, social violence in a country and COVID-19 pandemics worldwide.Originality/valueIt uncovers subjects' intelligent interactively trading behaviors.

How to grasp the movement of stock price and predict its trend have been the focus of investors and investment companies. Since expert stock comments contain abundant essential information for investment decisions, how to identify the topic of expert stock comments with high precision and efficiency is an important research topic. However, the existing methods usually employ single feature selection strategies for topic identification of stock comments, which may lead to low accuracy. Thus, to deal with this limitation, we propose a multi-level information fusion method to construct a topic identification system of stock comments. Specifically, wefirstlyfuse various complementary feature selection methods via a multi-view learning framework which can comprehensively represent text-based topics.In addition, regarding the decision process, we propose a fusion strategy based on belief value which can further improve the classification performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-level information fusion method is not only superior to other methods in terms of classification, it is also able to accurately capture topics of expert stock comments.

We fill this void by examining the market reaction of energy firms to a unique international sample of 452 operational loss events announced between 1996 and 2021, constructed using the SAS OpRisk Global Data database. Our results reveal negative and significant abnormal returns following the announcement of operational losses, while further analysis shows that results vary with event and/or announcing firm characteristics. Our evidence can help inform multiple stakeholders in the energy industry in the pricing, asset allocation, and risk management functions, as well as help regulators design effective mechanisms to mitigate the impact of operational losses on the economy and society.

J	Feder-Sempach, E; Szczepocki, P				Feder-Sempach, Ewa; Szczepocki, Piotr			The Bayesian Method in Estimating Polish and German Industry Betas. A Comparative Analysis of the Risk between the Main Economic Sectors from 2001-2020	COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC RESEARCH-CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE			English	Article						industry beta; CAPM; Bayesian method; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Polish Stock Market; German Stock Market	STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; EQUILIBRIUM; REGRESSION; PRICES	This paper examines the long-term dependence between the Polish and German stock markets in terms of industry beta risk estimates according to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The main objective of this research is to compare the Polish and German beta parameters of five Polish and three German sector indices using the Bayesian methodology in the period 2001-2020. The study has two detailed aims. First, to develop a modified, Bayesian approach (SBETA model) that generates significantly more precise beta than the traditional model. Second, to compare the results of different time-varying industry betas in the Polish and German economies, giving a simple investment recommendation, i.e., which sector could be classified as aggressive or defensive. The betas were time-varying in both markets but less persistent in the German industries, which seems characteristic of an advanced economy. The Banking sector betas were the highest in both markets, implying the aggressive nature of that industry in the last twenty years. For the Polish market industry, the betas of Construction, IT, Food and Drinks, and Telecom were classified as defensive. For the German economy, the Technologies (IT) sector was also classified as aggressive, but Telecom was defensive. The results give a valuable insight into the systematic risk levels in Poland and Germany, reflecting the investors' learning process and indicating that Polish Banking and German technologies outperformed the market in the last twenty years.

REVIEW OF ASSET PRICING STUDIES			English	Article							LONG-RUN RISKS; ECONOMIC-NEWS; STOCK-MARKET; CONSUMPTION; BOND; QUALITY; EXPLANATION; COVARIANCE; RETURNS	We contribute to identifying proxies for the information set of investors in financial markets. We show that the market wide price-dividend ratio highly correlates with inflation and labor market variables that also forecast consumption, dividend, and GDP growth, but not with aggregate consumption or GDP growth. Our model with learning from inflation and wage earnings rationalizes the moments of consumption and dividend growth, market return, the price-dividend ratio, real and nominal term structures, the low predictive power of the price-dividend ratio for consumption and dividends, and the dynamics of the price-dividend ratio, unlike a nested model with learning from consumption alone.

The purpose of the return of premium clauses is to safeguard the rights of DC pension plan participants who pass away during accumulation. We assume that the market price of risk consists of observable and unobservable factors that follow the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and the pension fund managers estimate the unobservable component from known information through Bayesian learning. Considering maximizing the expected utility of fund wealth at the terminal time, optimal investment strategies and the corresponding value function are determined using the dynamical programming principle approach and the filtering technique. Additionally, fund managers forsake learning, which results in the presentation of suboptimal strategies and utility losses for comparative analysis. Lastly, numerical analyses are included to demonstrate the impact of model parameters on the optimal strategy.

J	Martinsuo, M; Ahola, T				Martinsuo, Miia; Ahola, Tuomas			Multi-project management in inter-organizational contexts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multi -project management; Inter -organizational; Sequence; Strategy; Program	PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; RISK-MANAGEMENT; PROGRAM MANAGEMENT; COMPLEX PRODUCTS; DECISION-MAKING; WORKS PORTFOLIO; FRONT-END; CONSTRUCTION; CAPABILITIES	Multi-project management is typically considered an intra-organizational endeavor of implementing strategies through programs, portfolios, or lineages of change and development projects. Inter-organizational multi-project management takes place between project-based firms and other actors in project networks. The multi-project aspects in inter-organizational contexts cause significant management complexity, but their specific requirements are inadequately understood. This article explores the nature and requirements of project-based firms' multi-project management in inter-organizational contexts. Parallel and sequential inter-organizational multi-project settings are proposed as an expansion to the dominant intra-organizational research. A thematic framework is developed based on stakeholder and agency theories and previous knowledge from portfolio and program management research complemented with an inductive analysis of extant literature. Consequently, we map and report previous research on multi-project management requirements relevant to inter-organizational contexts concerning strategy, resources, governance, and learning. Propositions are developed and future research is recommended in these domains.

J	Glasserman, P; Mamaysky, H				Glasserman, Paul; Mamaysky, Harry			Investor Information Choice with Macro and Micro Information	REVIEW OF ASSET PRICING STUDIES			English	Article						G12; G14; G23	PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; GROWTH; NEWS	We develop a model of information and portfolio choice in which ex ante identical investors choose to specialize because of fixed attention costs required in learning about securities. Without this friction, investors would invest in all securities and would be indifferent across a wide range of information choices. When securities' dividends depend on an aggregate (macro) risk factor and idiosyncratic (micro) shocks, fixed attention costs lead investors to specialize in either macro or micro information. Our results favor Samuelson's dictum that markets are more micro than macro efficient.

J	Byrne, JP; Cao, S				Byrne, Joseph P.; Cao, Shuo			Decomposing Uncertainty in Macro-Finance Term Structure Models	REVIEW OF ASSET PRICING STUDIES			English	Article							MONETARY-POLICY; YIELD CURVE; INFLATION	This paper studies the extent to which macro-finance term structure models are susceptible to predictive uncertainty. We propose a general form of arbitrage-free models and quantify the relative importance of unpredictable priced risk variance, as well as macro-finance model uncertainty and learning uncertainty in predictability. Predictive performance and relative contributions of uncertainty sources are dynamically measured based on Bayesian methods, revealing dominating priced risk variance and other important uncertainty sources at different points in time. Macro-finance model uncertainty is high for near-term forward spread forecasts and contributes up to 87% of predictive uncertainty prior to recessions, implying strong dispersion in the information content of macro variables when forming near-term monetary policy expectations.

Assume that the stock return rate is related to the market state, which is described by an unobservable continuous-time, homogeneous Markov chain. In addition, the inflation risk and the stochastic salary are considered in our model. Firstly, the optimal investment problem for the DC plan under partial information is transformed into one under complete information by using the Wonham filtering theory. Then, by solving an extended HJB system of equations, the time-consistent investment strategy and corresponding value function are derived. Furthermore, we compare the time-consistent strategy under partial information with that under complete information and the suboptimal strategy when ignoring learning. Finally, the Monte Carlo method is used for sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis of different strategies, and the associated economic explanations are provided.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

J	Goldman, J; Peress, J				Goldman, Jim; Peress, Joel			Firm R&D and financial analysis: How do they interact?	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION			English	Article						Financial analysis; Learning; Capital allocation; Technological progress; Innovation; Growth	INVESTMENT ANALYSIS; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; COVERAGE; STATE; COMPETITION; EQUITY; GROWTH; BANKS; DEBT	This paper demonstrates, theoretically and empirically, that firms' research and development (R&D) efforts and investors' analyses of their prospects are mutually reinforcing. Entrepreneurs attempt more research when financiers are better informed about projects' profitability because they expect financiers to provide more funding to successful projects. Conversely, financiers collect more information about projects when entrepreneurs undertake more R&D because the opportunity cost of missing out on successful projects is then higher. Two natural experiments confirm that this interaction occurs and suggest that it contributes to about one third of the total effect of a policy designed to stimulate R&D. Overall, the analysis suggests that policies aimed at promoting R&D - such as research subsidies or tax breaks - have a multiplier effect owing to the induced improvement in capital efficiency. As a result, those policies can be rendered more effective by coupling them with other policies designed to increase capital efficiency. The feedback effect that we document also helps explaining why innovative ecosystems such as that in the Silicon Valley are challenging to set up.

Recently, statistical jump models have been proposed to learn regimes with high persistence, based on clustering temporal features while explicitly penalizing jumps across regimes. In this article, we extend the jump model by generalizing the discrete hidden state variable into a probability vector over all regimes. This allows us to estimate the probability of being in each regime, providing valuable information for downstream tasks such as regime-aware portfolio models and risk management. Our model's smooth transition from one regime to another enhances robustness over the original discrete model. We provide a probabilistic interpretation of our continuous model and demonstrate its advantages through simulations and real-world data experiments. The interpretation motivates a novel penalty term, called mode loss, which pushes the probability estimates to the vertices of the probability simplex thereby improving the model's ability to identify regimes. We demonstrate through a series of empirical and real world tests that the approach outperforms traditional regime-switching models. This outperformance is pronounced when the regimes are imbalanced and historical data is limited, both common in financial markets.

The model features investors (oligopolists) with different degrees of price impact and abilities to learn about individual asset payoffs from private and price signals, and a competitive fringe that only learns from asset prices. We show that price informativeness is non-monotonic in the oligopolists' aggregate size, decreasing in the sector's concentration and in the size of the passive sector. We further show that the size effect can be decomposed into a learning channel capturing investors' quality of private signals and an information pass-through channel measuring the sensitivity of investors' trades to private signals, with the latter one being the primary source of variation in price informativeness relative to the size distribution.
