Analysis of the inherent non-linear characteristics of stock market data is a challenging task. A large number of learning algorithms are developed to study market behaviours and enhance the prediction accuracy; they have been optimized using swarm and evolutionary computation such as particle swarm optimization (PSO); its global optimization ability with continuous data has been exploited in financial domains. Limitations in the existing approaches and potential future research directions for enhancing PSO-based stock market prediction are discussed.

E‐portfolios require secure, reliable, and privacy‐preserving credential issuance and verification mechanisms to prove learning achievements. However, existing systems provide private institution‐wide centralized solutions that primarily rely on trusted third parties to issue and verify credentials. Furthermore, they do not enable learners to own, control, and share their e‐portfolio information across organizations, which increases the risk of forged and fraudulent credentials. Therefore, we propose a consortium blockchain‐based e‐portfolio management scheme that is decentralized, secure, and trustworthy. Smart contracts are leveraged to enable learners to completely own, publish, and manage their e‐portfolios, and also enable potential employers to verify e‐port-folio credentials and artifacts without relying on trusted third parties. Blockchain is used as an immutable distributed ledger that records all transactions and logs for tamper‐proof trusted data provenance, accountability, and traceability. This system guarantees the authenticity and integrity of user credentials and e‐portfolio data. Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials are used for user profile identification, authentication, and authorization, whereas verifiable claims are used for e‐portfolio credential proof authentication and verification. We have designed and implemented a prototype of the proposed scheme using a Quorum consortium blockchain network. Based on the evaluations, our solution is feasible, secure, and privacy‐preserving. It offers excellent performance. © 2022 by the authors.

In particular, we propose to use a combination of recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) and particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with Calmar ratio for both asset allocation and constraint optimization. Using S&P100 index stocks, we show such a system with a Calmar ratio based objective function yields a better efficient frontier than the Sharpe ratio and mean-variance based portfolios. By comparing with multiple PSO based long only constrained portfolios, we propose an optimal portfolio trading system that is capable of generating both long and short signals and handling the common portfolio constraints. We further develop an adaptive RRL-PSO portfolio rebalancing decision system with a market condition stop-loss retraining mechanism, and we show that the proposed portfolio trading system outperforms the benchmarks consistently especially under high transaction cost conditions. © 2019",Optimal portfolio rebalancing; Particle swarm optimization; Portfolio constraint; Recurrent reinforcement learning,Commerce; Constrained optimization; Costs; Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reinforcement learning; Swarm intelligence; Constrained portfolios; Constraint optimizations; Objective functions; Optimal portfolios; Particle swarm algorithm; Portfolio constraints; Rebalancing; Recurrent reinforcement learning; Electronic trading,"S.Y.

To meet this challenge, adaptive stock trading strategies with deep reinforcement learning methods are proposed. For the time-series nature of stock market data, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is applied to extract informative financial features, which can represent the intrinsic characteristics of the stock market for adaptive trading decisions. Furthermore, with the tailored design of state and action spaces, two trading strategies with reinforcement learning methods are proposed as GDQN (Gated Deep Q-learning trading strategy) and GDPG (Gated Deterministic Policy Gradient trading strategy). To verify the robustness and effectiveness of GDQN and GDPG, they are tested both in the trending and in the volatile stock market from different countries. Experimental results show that the proposed GDQN and GDPG not only outperform the Turtle trading strategy but also achieve more stable returns than a state-of-the-art direct reinforcement learning method, DRL trading strategy, in the volatile stock market. As far as the GDQN and the GDPG are compared, experimental results demonstrate that the GDPG with an actor-critic framework is more stable than the GDQN with a critic-only framework in the ever-evolving stock market.

In contrast to parametric model based solutions computed by a partial differential equation approach, the proposed computational framework can scale to high dimensional multi-asset problems. More importantly, the proposed approach can determine the optimal NN control directly from market returns, without assuming a particular parametric model for the return process. We validate the proposed NN learning solution by comparing the NN control to the optimal control determined by solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB equation solution is based on a double exponential jump model calibrated to the historical market data. The NN control achieves nearly optimal performance. An alternative data-driven approach (without the need of a parametric model) is based on using the historic bootstrap resampling data sets. Robustness is checked by training with a blocksize different from the test data. In both two and three asset cases, we compare performance of the NN controls directly learned from the market return sample paths and demonstrate that they always significantly outperform constant proportion strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Asset allocation; Data-driven; Neural network,,"P.A.

An interesting sector is related to the definition of dynamic decision-making systems. A possible example is dynamic portfolio optimization, where an agent has to continuously reallocate an amount of fund into a number of different financial assets with the final goal of maximizing return and minimizing risk. In this work, a novel deep Q-learning portfolio management framework is proposed. The framework is composed by two elements: a set of local agents that learn assets behaviours and a global agent that describes the global reward function. The framework is tested on a crypto portfolio composed by four cryptocurrencies. Based on our results, the deep reinforcement portfolio management framework has proven to be a promising approach for dynamic portfolio optimization. © 2020, The Author(s).",Deep reinforcement learning; Dueling double deep Q-networks; Portfolio management; Q-learning,Cryptocurrency; Decision making; Financial data processing; Investments; Reinforcement learning; Dynamic decision making; Dynamic portfolios; Financial assets; Portfolio managements; Q-learning; Reward function; Deep learning,"M.

In this article, we argue that the investment process can be accelerated and be made more cohesive by replacing batch processing for component tasks of the investment process with online processing. We propose an integrated and online framework for investment workflows, where components produce outputs that are automatically and sequentially updated as new data arrives. The workflow can be further enhanced to refine signal generation and asset class evolution and definitions. Our results demonstrate that we use this framework in conjunction with resampling methods to optimise component decisions with direct reference to investment objectives while making clear the extent of backtest overfitting. We consider such an online update framework to be a crucial step towards developing intelligent portfolio selection algorithms that integrate financial theory, investor views, and data analysis with process-level learning. © 2020 Investment Analysts Society of South Africa.",machine learning; online adaptive learning; portfolio management,,"A.B.

Researchers have investigated various state of the art machine learning models to predict Bitcoin price and volatility. Machine learning models like recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have been shown to perform better than traditional time series models in cryptocurrency price prediction. However, very few studies have applied sequence models with robust feature engineering to predict future pricing. In this study, we investigate a framework with a set of advanced machine learning forecasting methods with a fixed set of exogenous and endogenous factors to predict daily Bitcoin prices. We study and compare different approaches using the root mean squared error (RMSE). Experimental results show that the gated recurring unit (GRU) model with recurrent dropout performs better than popular existing models. We also show that simple trading strategies, when implemented with our proposed GRU model and with proper learning, can lead to financial gain. © 2020 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; deep learning; neural networks; predictive model; risk management; time series analysis; trading strategy,,"A.

The incorporation of such views may inject subjectivity to the modeling phase. There is a recent literature on generating the views with financial forecasting methods, which employ either econometric or learning algorithms. In this research, we aim to propose a hybrid approach to the stream, in which GARCH modeling is used for predicting indicators for the stocks, followed by translating the indicator forecasts to return forecasts through Support Vector Regression. The obtained return forecasts are then fed into Black–Litterman modeling as investor views vector in order to generate portfolios with rolling data. The proposed model is tested in two markets: an emerging market (BIST-30 index of Istanbul Stock Exchange) and a developed market (Dow Jones Index of US Stock Market). In general, the results reveal better portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios than the index return for different holding periods, as well as better portfolio returns than randomly generated portfolios. We further show that the indicators can be accounted relying on the state or the market (non-trending or trending). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Black–Litterman model; GARCH modeling; Portfolio optimization; Support vector regression,Commerce; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Investments; Asset allocation; Emerging markets; Financial forecasting; GARCH models; Hybrid approach; Istanbul stock exchange; Portfolio optimization; Support vector regression (SVR); Financial markets,"K.B.

In this hybrid model, share price index futures are decomposed to extract data characteristics at different time scales by the wavelet transform and the ARIMA-LSTM model are applied to predict the close price of futures. The findings of the study are as follows. 1) The DWT hybrid model and the MODWT hybrid model have higher forecasting accuracy than some commonly used forecasting models under the three metrics of MAE, MAPE and RMSE. The DWT-ARIMA-LSTM model has better forecasting performance when the forecasting performance in different markets and the operational efficiency of the method are combined. 2) The DWT method is more applicable than the MODWT method in forecasting models of futures closing price series; the approximate signals obtained from the DWT decomposition have lower volatility and can better characterise the original signals. 3) The LSTM model has better prediction performance for noisy residual series, while the ARIMA model has better prediction performance for less noisy approximate signals. 4) Based on the forecasting results, a timing trading strategy is constructed that can maintain a robust return performance under different market conditions, especially on the risk side with significant advantages. In addition, this work examines the impact of the unexpected event of the COVID-19 epidemic on the forecasting performance of the model, and the results show that the model can adapt to different data structures to achieve more robust forecasting performance.

The traditional Markowitz mean-variance model is often unrealistic since it relies on the perfect market information. In this work, we propose a two-stage stochastic portfolio optimization model with a comprehensive set of real-world trading constraints to address this issue. Our model incorporates the market uncertainty in terms of future asset price scenarios based on asset return distributions stemming from the real market data. Compared with existing models, our model is more reliable since it encompasses real-world trading constraints and it adopts CVaR as the risk measure. Furthermore, our model is more practical because it could help investors to design their future investment strategies based on their future asset price expectations. In order to solve the proposed stochastic model, we develop a hybrid combinatorial approach, which integrates a hybrid algorithm and a linear programming (LP) solver for the problem with a large number of scenarios. The comparison of the computational results obtained with three different metaheuristic algorithms and with our hybrid approach shows the effectiveness of the latter. The superiority of our model is mainly embedded in solution quality. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of solving complex portfolio optimization problems with tremendous scenarios while maintaining high solution quality in a reasonable amount of time and it has outstanding practical investment implications, such as effective portfolio constructions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Combinatorial approach; Hybrid algorithm; Learning inheritance; Local search; Population-based incremental learning; Portfolio optimization problem; Stochastic programming,Combinatorial mathematics; Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Linear programming; Risk assessment; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Combinatorial approach; Hybrid algorithms; Learning inheritance; Local search; Population based incremental learning; Portfolio optimization; Stochastic models,"T.

The data for this analysis is based on 127,000 research clusters (RCs) that are derived from 1.4 billion citation links between 104.8 million documents from four databases (Dimensions, Microsoft Academic Graph, Web of Science, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure). Of these RCs, 600 large clusters are associated with AI/ML topics, and 161 of these AI/ML RCs are expected to experience extreme growth between May 2020 and May 2023. Funding acknowledgments (in the corpus of the 104.9 million documents) are used to characterize the overall AI/ML research portfolios of each organization. NNSFC is the largest funder of AI/ML research and disproportionately funds computer vision. The EC, RC, and JSPS focus more efforts on natural language processing and robotics. The NSF and ERC are more focused on fundamental advancement of AI/ML rather than on applications. They are more likely to participate in the RCs that are expected to have extreme growth. NIH funds the largest relative share of general AI/ML research papers (meaning in areas other than computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics). We briefly describe how insights such as these could be applied to portfolio management decision-making.

The framework consists of two primary components: (1) regime modeling and prediction and (2) identifying a regime-based strategy to enhance the performance of a risk parity portfolio. For the former, they apply supervised learning algorithms, including the random forest, based on a large macroeconomic database to estimate the probability of an upcoming recession or a stock market contraction. Out-of-sample tests show the reliability of these predictions, especially for recessions in the United States, over the period 1973 to 2020. The probability estimates are linked to a dynamic investment overlay strategy. The combined approach improves risk-adjusted returns by a substantial amount over nominal risk parity in two-asset and multi-asset test cases, even during rising interest rates in the late 1970s. © 2021, With intelligence.

The most common models in the investment industry are linear, a development that is no doubt the result of their familiarity and relative simplicity. Linear models, however, often fail to capture important information regarding asset behavior. To address the latter shortcoming, the authors show how to use random forests, a machine learning algorithm, to produce factor frameworks that improve upon more traditional models in terms of their ability to account for nonlinearities and interaction effects among variables, as well as their higher explanatory power. The authors also demonstrate, by means of a simple example, how combining the random forest algorithm with another machine learning framework known as association rule learning can produce viable trading strategies. Machine learning methods thus show themselves to be effective tools for both ex post risk decomposition and ex ante investment decision-making. © 2019 With Intelligence Ltd..",Big data/machine learning; Factor-based models; Portfolio management/multi-asset,,"D.

In each period, the risk-aversion coefficient is adjusted automatically according to market trend movements predicted by machine learning models. We employ Gini’s Mean Difference (GMD) to specify the risk of a portfolio and use a set of technical indicators generated from a market index (e.g., S&P 500 index) to feed the machine learning models to predict market movements. Using a rolling-horizon approach, we conduct a series of computational tests with real financial data to evaluate the performance of the machine learning integrated portfolio rebalance framework. The empirical results show that the XGBoost model provides the best prediction of market movement, while the proposed portfolio rebalance strategy generates portfolios with superior out-of-sample performances in terms of average returns, time-series cumulative returns, and annualized returns compared to the benchmarks. © 2020 by the authors.",information fusion; machine learning models; Mean-Gini model; portfolio optimization; risk-aversion coefficient; technical indicators,,"R.

They have infiltrated most financial transactions and as a result cryptocurrency trade is generally considered one of the most popular and promising types of profitable investments. Nevertheless, this constantly increasing financial market is characterized by significant volatility and strong price fluctuations over a short-time period therefore, the development of an accurate and reliable forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio management and optimization. In this research, we propose a multiple-input deep neural network model for the prediction of cryptocurrency price and movement. The proposed forecasting model utilizes as inputs different cryptocurrency data and handles them independently in order to exploit useful information from each cryptocurrency separately. An extensive empirical study was performed using three consecutive years of cryptocurrency data from three cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization i.e., Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), and Ripple (XRP). The detailed experimental analysis revealed that the proposed model has the ability to efficiently exploit mixed cryptocurrency data, reduces overfitting and decreases the computational cost in comparison with traditional fully-connected deep neural networks. © 2021 by the authors.

We connect our model to a robust portfolio selection problem, and investigate effects of the SGLasso regularization on the optimal strategy both theoretically and empirically. We develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal portfolio and prove its global convergence.

Cryptocurrency is not only one of the most complicated and abstruse fields among financial instruments but also deemed as a perplexing problem in finance due to its high volatility. This work makes an attempt to apply machine learning techniques on the index and constituents of cryptocurrency with a goal to predict and forecast prices thereof. In particular, the purpose of this article is to predict and forecast the close (closing) price of the cryptocurrency index 30 and nine constituents of cryptocurrencies using machine learning algorithms and models so that it becomes easier for people to trade these currencies. We have used several machine learning techniques and algorithms and compared the models with each other to get the best output. We believe that our work will help reduce the challenges and difficulties faced by people who invest in cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the obtained results can play a major role in cryptocurrency portfolio management and in observing the fluctuations in the prices of constituents of cryptocurrency market. We have also compared our approach with similar state of the art works from the literature, where machine learning approaches have been considered for predicting and forecasting the prices of these currencies. In the sequel, we have found that our best approach presents better and competitive results (especially by using ensemble learning method) than the best works from the literature thereby advancing the state of the art. Using such prediction and forecasting methods, people can easily understand the trend and it would be even easier for them to trade in a difficult and challenging financial instrument like cryptocurrency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Close price; Cryptocurrency constituents; Cryptocurrency index; Data mining; Forecasting; Machine learning; Prediction,Costs; Cryptocurrency; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Investments; Machine learning; Ensemble learning; Financial sectors; High volatility; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Portfolio managements; Prediction and forecasting; State of the art; Learning algorithms,"M.R.C.

Analysis of the interconnectedÂness between assets and factors shows that their relaÂtionship is strong. The authors compare the allocation techniques, considering centrality and hierarchal-based networks. They demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the advantages to portfolio manageÂment and the dynamic nature of assets and factors with their ""importance score."" They find that asset allocaÂtion can be efficiently derived using directed networks, dynamically driven by both US Treasuries and curÂrency returns with significant centrality scores. AlterÂnatively, the inverse variance weight estimation and correlation-based networks generate factor allocation with favorable risk-return parameters. Furthermore, factor allocation is driven mostly by the importance scores of the Fama-French-Carhart factors: SMB, HML, CMA, RMW, and MOM. The authors confirm previous results and argue that both factors and assets are interconnected with different value and momentum factors. Therefore, a blended strategy comprising factors and assets can be defensible for investors. As argued in previous research, factors are much more overcrowded than assets. Therefore, the centrality scores help to identify the crowded expoÂsure and build diversified allocation. The authors run LASSO regressions and show how the network-based allocation can be implemented using machine learning. © 2020 Journal of Portfolio Management.

P2P lenders usually are inexpert, so helping them to make the best decision for their investments is vital. In this study, while we aim to compare the performance of different artificial neural network (ANN) models, we evaluate loans from two perspectives: risk and return. The net present value (NPV) is considered as the return variable. To the best of our knowledge, NPV has been used in few studies in the P2P lending context. Considering the advantages of using NPV, we aim to improve decision-making models in this market by the use of NPV and the integration of supervised learning and optimization algorithms that can be considered as one of our contributions. In order to predict NPV, three ANN models are compared concerning mean square error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to find the optimal ANN model. Furthermore, for the risk evaluation, the probability of default of loans is computed using logistic regression. Investors in the P2P lending market can share their assets between different loans, so the procedure of P2P investment is similar to portfolio optimization. In this context, we minimize the risk of a portfolio for a minimum acceptable level of return. To analyse the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compare our decision-making algorithm with the output of a traditional model. The experimental results on a real-world data set show that our model leads to a better investment concerning both risk and return. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",net present value; peer-to-peer lending; portfolio optimization,,"S.

An energy retrofit of this building stock is needed to meet the current European goals on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The retrofit is also needed in order to guarantee adequate comfort levels in indoor spaces and good conditions for learning and educational activities, that are often not reached in poor quality constructions. This work presents the results of an interdisciplinary study related to the energy requalification of a school located in Ostia, near Rome in Italy, built in the 1960s with a steel structure and Eternit infill. The scope of the analysis is to verify the economic and environmental effectiveness of four proposed retrofit interventions concerning the replacement of fixtures and the installation of an insulating coat. The current thermal transmittance of the walls was evaluated through thermofluximetric measurements conducted in situ; dynamic simulations were performed to determine the current energy performance and the energy performances following the four proposed retrofit scenarios. Energy and carbon payback times were evaluated (by means of the life cycle analysis (LCA) approach) and the economic value was determined for each of the four proposed retrofits, using a probabilistic approach. The results show that the replacement of windows is the most convenient intervention from all points of view. The study provides evidence that an assessment of schools’ energy retrofits should include both economic and life cycle aspects. © 2020 by the authors.

"Du, NN; Liu, YK; Liu, Y",,,A New Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Portfolio Optimization Method Based on Wasserstein Ambiguity Set,2021,IEEE ACCESS,,,,,,,14,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047967,,,,"Since optimal portfolio strategy depends heavily on the distribution of uncertain returns, this article proposes a new method for the portfolio optimization problem with respect to distribution uncertainty. When the distributional information of the uncertain return rate is only observable through a finite sample dataset, we model the portfolio selection problem with a robust optimization method from the data-driven perspective. We first develop an ambiguous mean-CVaR portfolio optimization model, where the ambiguous distribution set employed in the distributionally robust model is a Wasserstein ball centered within the empirical distribution. In addition, the computationally tractable equivalent model of the worst-case expectation under the uncertainty set of a cone is derived, and some theoretical conclusions of the box, budget and ellipsoid uncertainty set are obtained. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our mean-CVaR portfolio optimization method, two practical examples concerning the Chinese stock market and United States stock market are considered. Furthermore, some numerical experiments are carried out under different uncertainty sets. The proposed data-driven distributionally robust portfolio optimization method offers some advantages over the ambiguity-free stochastic optimization method. The numerical experiments illustrate that the new method is effective.",Portfolio optimization; data-driven; mean-CVaR; Wasserstein metric; distributionally robust,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Du, Ningning; Liu, Yankui; Liu, Ying",,,,,English,,,,,,,"[Du, Ningning; Liu, Ying] Hebei Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Risk Management & Financial Engn Lab, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yankui] Hebei Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Key Lab Machine Learning & Computat Intelligence, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China",Hebei University; Hebei University,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Risk Management & Financial Engn Lab, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China.",yingliu@hbu.edu.cn,"; Liu, Yan-Kui/IUN-3017-2023","Liu, Ying/0000-0002-4182-4773; Liu, Yan-Kui/0000-0002-3106-6761","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773150, 61374184]; Advanced Talents Incubation Program of the Hebei University [801260201209]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Advanced Talents Incubation Program of the Hebei University,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61773150 and Grant 61374184, and in part by the Advanced Talents Incubation Program of the Hebei University under Grant 801260201209.","Alexander GJ, 2004, MANAGE SCI, V50, P1261, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1040.0201; Altinoz M, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P57779, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914115; Ben-Tal A, 2013, MANAGE SCI, V59, P341, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1120.1641; BenTal A, 2009, PRINC SER APPL MATH, P1; Bertsimas D, 2018, MATH PROGRAM, V171, P217, DOI 10.1007/s10107-017-1174-z; Bertsimas D, 2018, MATH PROGRAM, V167, P235, DOI 10.1007/s10107-017-1125-8; Carlsson JG, 2018, OPER RES, V66, P1603, DOI 10.1287/opre.2018.1746; Çetinkaya E, 2015, OR SPECTRUM, V37, P761, DOI 10.1007/s00291-015-0396-9; Chang ZQ, 2019, EUR J OPER RES, V272, P832, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2018.07.007; Chi GT, 2019, MATH PROBL ENG, V2019, DOI 10.1155/2019/1902970; Delage E, 2010, OPER RES, V58, P595, DOI 10.1287/opre.1090.0741; Duan C, 2018, IEEE T POWER SYST, V33, P4924, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2807623; Esfahani PM, 2018, MATH PROGRAM, V171, P115, DOI 10.1007/s10107-017-1172-1; Fernandes B, 2016, EUR J OPER RES, V255, P961, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2016.05.038; Francq C, 2018, J ECONOMETRICS, V205, P381, DOI 10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.03.018; Gao R, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P146046, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946260; Gupta V, 2019, MANAGE SCI, V65, P4242, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.2018.3140; Hanasusanto GA, 2018, OPER RES, V66, P849, DOI 10.1287/opre.2017.1698; HETTICH R, 1993, SIAM REV, V35, P380, DOI 10.1137/1035089; Jiang RW, 2016, MATH PROGRAM, V158, P291, DOI 10.1007/s10107-015-0929-7; Kang ZL, 2019, QUANT FINANC, V19, P105, DOI 10.1080/14697688.2018.1466057; Kantorovich L., 1958, Vestnik Leningrad.

Many fully automated trading systems or strategies have been built using DRL agents, which integrate price prediction and trading signal generation in one system. However, the previous agents extract the current state from the market data without considering the long-term market historical trend when making decisions. Besides, plenty of related and useful information has not been considered. To address these two problems, we propose a novel model named Parallel Multi-Module Deep Reinforcement Learning (PMMRL) algorithm. Here, two parallel modules are used to extract and encode the feature: one module employing Fully Connected (FC) layers is used to learn the current state from the market data of the traded stock and the fundamental data of the issuing company; another module using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers aims to detect the long-term historical trend of the market. The proposed model can extract features from the whole environment by the above two modules simultaneously, taking the advantages of both LSTM and FC layers. Extensive experiments on China stock market illustrate that the proposed PMMRL algorithm achieves a higher profit and a lower drawdown than several state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Capital asset pricing model; Long short-term memory; Parallel multi-module; Reinforcement learning,Brain; Commerce; Data mining; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; 'current; Capital asset pricing model; Historical trends; Market data; Multi modules; Parallel multi-module; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Short term memory; Stock trading; article; China; profit; reinforcement learning (machine learning); short term memory; stock market; Long short-term memory,"J.

The most familiar and widely used approach in the field of portfolio optimization is the mean–variance framework introduced by Markowitz. Following this pioneering work, many researchers have extended this model to make it more practical and adapt to real-life problems. In this study, one of these extensions, the cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem, is considered. Cardinality constraints transform the quadratic optimization model into the mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, which is proved to be NP-Hard, making it harder to obtain an optimal solution within a reasonable time by using exact solution methodologies. Hence, the vast majority of the researchers have taken advantage of approximate algorithms to overcome arising computational difficulties. To develop an efficient solution approach for cardinality constrained portfolio optimization, in this study, a parallel variable neighborhood search algorithm combined with quadratic programming is proposed. While the variable neighborhood search algorithm decides the combination of assets to be held in the portfolio, quadratic programming quickly calculates the proportions of assets. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on five well-known datasets and compared with other solution approaches in the literature. Obtained results confirm that the proposed solution approach is very efficient especially on the portfolios with low risk and highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Asynchronous parallelization; Metaheuristics; Portfolio optimization; Quadratic programming; Variable neighborhood search,Constrained optimization; Decision making; Financial data processing; Learning algorithms; Quadratic programming; Approximate algorithms; Cardinality constraints; Constrained portfolios; Decision-making strategies; Mixed integer quadratic programming; Quadratic optimization; State-of-the-art algorithms; Variable neighborhood search; Integer programming,"C.B.

Thus, reducing the overall energy use and associated emissions in buildings is crucial for meeting sustainability goals for the future. In recent years, smart energy meters have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy use data with hourly or sub-hourly temporal resolution. The concurrent rise of information technologies and data analytics enabled the development of novel applications such as customer segmentation, load profiling, demand response, energy forecasting and anomaly detection. In this paper, we address load profiling and benchmarking, i.e., determining peer groups for buildings. Traditionally, static characteristics, e.g., primary space use (PSU) together with the annual energy-use-intensity (EUI) have been used to compare the performance of buildings. Data-driven benchmarking approaches have begun to also consider the shape of the load profiles as a means for comparison. In this work, we identify three fundamental load shape profiles that characterize the temporal energy use in any building. We obtain this result by collecting a dataset of unprecedented variety in size (3829 buildings) and primary use (75 programs), and applying a rigorous clustering analysis followed by entropy calculation for each building. The existence of fundamental load shape profiles challenges the man-made, artificial classification of buildings. We demonstrate in a benchmarking application that the resulting data-driven groups are more homogeneous, and therefore more suitable for comparisons between buildings.

Hence, when decision-makers in highly-regulated domains like Finance implement these technological advances—especially Artificial Intelligence—regulators prescribe high levels of transparency, assuring the traceability of decisions for third parties. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is of tremendous importance in this context. We provide an overview of current research on XAI in Finance with a systematic literature review screening 2,022 articles from leading Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science outlets. We identify a set of 60 relevant articles, classify them according to the used XAI methods and goals that they aim to achieve, and provide an overview of XAI methods used in different Finance areas. Areas like risk management, portfolio optimization, and applications around the stock market are well-researched, while anti-money laundering is understudied. Researchers implement both transparent models and post-hoc explainability, while they recently favored the latter. © The Author(s) 2023.",Explainable artificial intelligence; Finance; G00; L50; Machine learning; Review; Systematic literature review,,"P.

In a fast-paced world where convenience and accessibility of products is highly sought after the vending industry has provided a suitable solution. Although the economic impact of the vending industry is indisputable, it is not without challenges, especially when it comes to the efficiency of the vending logistics operations. The optimisation of logistic vending machine systems is decidedly complex. Product allocation to columns in a vending machine, replenishment points of products, product thresholds at vending machines, and vehicle routes for inventory replenishments are all essential challenges in vending machine system management and operation. If all facets of the problem were to be addressed, it would require techniques such as forecasting, machine learning, data mining, combinatorial optimization and vehicle routing, among others. In the past, these approaches have been explored individually despite their intrinsic interdependence within the problem. This paper aims to help to fill in this gap and proposes a model for the optimisation of product allocation within a vending machine under the constraint of fixed restocking instances. The optimal product allocation is based on the definition of product profitability which accounts for the net revenue earned after the cost of restock, as opposed to the revenue earned until first stock-out to prevent arbitrary extension of the stock-out period. The whole approach is encompassed in the simulation-optimisation framework that utilises a Genetic Algorithm, with fitness evaluated as simulated revenue, to determine the optimal product allocation. The acceptable threshold of missed sales for a machine is also determined as a means to make intelligent restocking decisions. Overall, the proposed approach allows the strengths of mathematically robust optimization algorithms and the implementation of analytic solutions to be combined and applied to realistic scenarios where uncertainty may rule out some high quality analytic solutions. It respects problem intricacies proper to vending and addresses the interdependence between routing and portfolio optimisation. The proposal is application-driven and stems from a collaboration with an industry partner. The model is validated against an authentic data set supplied by the partner. The case study results revealed a network-wide improvement in net revenue of approximately 3.4%, with varied efficacy based on machine popularity. The method of optimisation was found to be significantly more effective for higher performing machines, with median improvements as high as 6%. Our framework based on the optimization-simulation model yields clear benefits to vending logistics operations management. The simulation component provides the decision maker with a more comprehensive view on the actual implementation of the solution. Effectively, the joint use of simulation and optimization methods provides managers with enhanced information to help decide on both: (i) the most beneficial product portfolio, and (ii) the quality of the proposed restocking schedules. Simulation-optimisation based approach is a powerful technique used to address stochastic problems. However, it was yet to be applied specifically to logistic vending machine systems. © 2019",Genetic algorithm; Portfolio optimisation; Simulation; Vending machine systems,Combinatorial optimization; Data mining; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Stochastic systems; Vehicle routing; Genetic algorithm approach; Inventory replenishment; Optimization-simulation models; Portfolio optimisation; Robust optimization algorithm; Simulation; Simulation and optimization; Simulation optimisation; Vending machines,"H.

Lifesaving RBC transfusions are facilitated by the cold storage of RBC units in blood banks worldwide. Currently, RBC storage and subsequent transfusion practices are performed using simplistic workflows. More specifically, most blood banks follow the ""first in first out"" principle to avoid wastage, whereas most healthcare providers prefer the ""last in first out"" approach simply favoring chronologically younger RBCs. Neither approach addresses recent advances through - omics showing that stored RBC quality is highly variable depending on donor-, time-, and processing-specific factors. Thus, it is time to rethink our workflows in transfusion medicine taking advantage of novel technologies to perform RBC quality assessment. We imagine a future where lab on a chip technologies utilize novel predictive markers of RBC quality identified by - omics and machine learning to usher in a new era of safer and precise transfusion medicine.",red blood cells; transfusion; preservation,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Isiksacan, Ziya; D'Alessandro, Angelo; Wolf, Susan M.; McKenna, David H.; Tessier, Shannon N.; Kucukal, Erdem; Gokaltun, A.

In this study, we propose a model that automates the portfolio structure by using the instability index of the financial time series and genetic algorithms (GAs). We use the instability index to filter the investment assets and optimize the threshold value used as a filtering criterion by applying a GA. For an empirical analysis, we use stocks, bonds, commodities exchange traded funds (ETFs), and exchange rate. We compare the performance of our model with that of risk parity and mean-variance models and find our model has better performance. Several additional experiments with our model using various internal parameters are conducted, and the proposed model with a one-month test period after one year of learning is found to provide the highest Sharpe ratio. © 2020 by the authors.",Asset allocation; Exchange traded funds; Financial market instability index; Genetic algorithm,financial market; genetic algorithm; index method; learning; model; threshold,"K.J.

That is, the agents do not question whether the economy is growing or not, but instead continuously estimate how long economic cycles will last—i.e., they learn about the persistence of fundamentals. Learning about persistence generates high and persistent stock return volatility mostly during recessions, but also (to a smaller extent) during economic booms. Disagreement among agents fluctuates and earns a risk premium. A clear risk–return trade-off appears only when conditioning on the sign and magnitude of disagreement.

For an infinite-horizon model with linear state dynamics and exogenous volatilities, we prove that the equilibrium returns mean-revert around their frictionless counterparts—the deviation has Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics for quadratic costs whereas it follows a doubly-reflected Brownian motion if costs are proportional. More general models with arbitrary state dynamics and endogenous volatilities lead to multidimensional systems of nonlinear, fully-coupled forward-backward SDEs. These fall outside the scope of known well-posedness results, but can be solved numerically using the simulation-based deep-learning approach of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018). In a calibration to time series of prices and trading volume, realistic liquidity premia are accompanied by a moderate increase in volatility. The effects of different cost specifications are rather similar, justifying the use of quadratic costs as a proxy for other less tractable specifications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Deep learning; forward–backward SDEs; radner equilibrium; transaction costs,,"J.

This asymmetry, which solely results from learning about persistence, causes expected returns, return volatility, and the price of risk to rise during recessions. Persistence risk predicts future excess returns, particularly at 3- to 7-year horizons. Its predictability is strongest around business-cycle peaks and troughs. We confirm the model's predictions in the data and provide evidence that persistence risk is priced in financial markets.

"Breeden, JL",,,A survey of machine learning in credit risk,2021,JOURNAL OF CREDIT RISK,,,,,,,13,10.21314/JCR.2021.008,,,,"Machine learning algorithms have come to dominate several industries. After decades of resistance from examiners and auditors, machine learning is now moving from the research desk to the application stack for credit scoring and a range of other applications in credit risk. This migration is not without novel risks and challenges. Much of the research is now shifting from how best to make the models to how best to use the models in a regulator-compliant business context. This paper surveys the impressively broad range of machine learning methods and application areas for credit risk. In the process of that survey, we create a taxonomy to think about how different machine learning components are matched to create specific algorithms. The reasons for where machine learning succeeds over simple linear methods are explored through a specific lending example. Throughout, we highlight open questions, ideas for improvements and a framework for thinking about how to choose the best machine learning method for a specific problem.",machine learning; artificial intelligence; credit risk; credit scoring; stress testing,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Breeden, Joseph L.",,,,,English,,,,,,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ART CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS; DATA MINING METHODS; NEURAL-NETWORK; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; SCORING MODELS; DECISION TREES,"[Breeden, Joseph L.] Prescient Models LLC, 1600 Lena St, Santa Fe, NM 87505 USA",,"Breeden, JL (corresponding author), Prescient Models LLC, 1600 Lena St, Santa Fe, NM 87505 USA.",breeden@prescientmodels.com,,,,,,"ABA Banking Journal, 2018, BLOG POST 1022; Abdou H, 2008, EXPERT SYST APPL, V35, P1275, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2007.08.030; Abdou HA, 2009, EXPERT SYST APPL, V36, P11402, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2009.01.076; Abedin MZ, 2018, J CREDIT RISK, V14, P1, DOI 10.21314/JCR.2017.233; Abellán J, 2014, EXPERT SYST APPL, V41, P3825, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2013.12.003; Ali HH, 2008, ECON J, V118, pF158, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2008.02147.x; Ali KM, 1996, MACH LEARN, V24, P173, DOI 10.1007/BF00058611; Allen L., 2020, SOCIAL NETWORKS CRED; ALMON S, 1965, ECONOMETRICA, V33, P178, DOI 10.2307/1911894; Ammermann S, 2013, CONSUMER COMPLIANCE; Anagnostou I, 2020, J CREDIT RISK, V16, P1, DOI 10.21314/JCR.2020.257; Anderson R., 2019, CREDIT INTELLIGENCE; Angelini E, 2008, Q REV ECON FINANC, V48, P733, DOI 10.1016/j.qref.2007.04.001; [Anonymous], 1994, An Introduction to Credit Scoring; [Anonymous], 2019, ADV NEUR IN; [Anonymous], 2005, ENCY BIOSTATISTICS, DOI DOI 10.1002/0470011815.B2A03003; [Anonymous], 1992, Managerial FinanceVol, DOI DOI 10.1108/EB013696/FULL/HTML?SKIPTRACKING=TRUE; [Anonymous], 1990, Time Series Analysis: Univariate and Multivariate Methods; [Anonymous], 2015, A critical review of recurrent neural networks for sequence learning; Apley DW, 2020, J ROY STAT SOC B, V82, P1059, DOI 10.1111/rssb.12377; Ardabili S, 2020, LECT NOTE NETW SYST, V101, P215, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-36841-8_21; Atiya AF, 2001, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V12, P929, DOI 10.1109/72.935101; Awasthi A., 2012, CLUSTERING ALGORITHM; Baesens B, 2003, J OPER RES SOC, V54, P627, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601545; Baesens B, 2002, EUR J OPER RES, V138, P191, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(01)00129-1; Bailey M, 2018, J ECON PERSPECT, V32, P259, DOI 10.1257/jep.32.3.259; Ban GY, 2018, MANAGE SCI, V64, P1136, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.2016.2644; Bangia A, 2002, J BANK FINANC, V26, P445, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(01)00229-1; Bastos J, 2007, 8034 MPRA; Bastos JA, 2010, J BANK FINANC, V34, P2510, DOI 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2010.04.011; Batista GE., 2004, ACM SIGKDD EXPL NEWS, V6, P20, DOI DOI 10.1145/1007730.1007735; Belkin Mikhail, 2018, ARXIV181211118; Bellotti A., 2019, Proceedings of the Credit Scoring and Credit Control Conference, VXVI, P1, DOI DOI 10.2139/SSRN.3434412; Bellotti A, 2017, ANN MATH ARTIF INTEL, V81, P71, DOI 10.1007/s10472-016-9534-6; Bellotti T, 2012, INT J FORECASTING, V28, P171, DOI 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2010.08.005; Berg T., 2018, On the rise of the Fintechs-Credit scoring using ditigal footprints, DOI [10.3386/w24551, DOI 10.3386/W24551]; Berger J., 2013, Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysi s; Best, 2017, QUADRATIC PROGRAMMIN, DOI [10.1201/9781315120881, DOI 10.1201/9781315120881]; Biganzoli E, 1998, STAT MED, V17, P1169, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19980530)17:10<1169::AID-SIM796>3.0.CO;2-D; Björkegren D, 2020, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V34, P618, DOI 10.1093/wber/lhz006; Blewitt ME, 2008, NAT GENET, V40, P663, DOI 10.1038/ng.142; Borda JC., 1781, HIST ACAD ROYALE SCI, V44, P42, DOI 10.1086/348187; Bottou Leon, 2012, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, P421, DOI [DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-35289-825, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-35289-8-25]; Boubaker H, 2013, J BANK FINANC, V37, P361, DOI 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2012.09.006; Breeden J.

Using a large data set from the Chinese stock market, we propose a return-risk trade-off strategy via a new transformer model. The empirical findings show that these updates, such as the self-attention mechanism in technology, can improve the use of time-series information related to returns and volatility, increase predictability, and capture more economic gains than other nonlinear models, such as LSTM. Our model employs Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to measure the “economic feature importance” and tabulates the different important features in the prediction process. Finally, we document several economic explanations for the TF model.

Like Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (KPS, 2019), our model allows for latent factors and factor exposures that depend on covariates such as asset characteristics. But, unlike the linearity assumption of KPS, we model factor exposures as a flexible nonlinear function of covariates. Our model retrofits the workhorse unsupervised dimension reduction device from the machine learning literature – autoencoder neural networks – to incorporate information from covariates along with returns themselves. This delivers estimates of nonlinear conditional exposures and the associated latent factors. Furthermore, our machine learning framework imposes the economic restriction of no-arbitrage. Our autoencoder asset pricing model delivers out-of-sample pricing errors that are far smaller (and generally insignificant) compared to other leading factor models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Autoencoder; Big data; Conditional asset pricing model; Machine learning; Neural networks; Nonlinear factor model; Stock returns,Costs; Machine learning; Asset pricing model; Auto encoders; Dimension reduction; Latent factor; Machine learning literature; Model factors; No arbitrage; Nonlinear functions; Financial markets,"S.

We find sizable distortions even for professional forecasters, with all respondent-types overweighting the implicit judgmental component of their forecasts relative to what can be learned from publicly available information. Forecasts of inflation and GDP growth oscillate between optimism and pessimism by large margins, with belief distortions evolving dynamically in response to cyclical shocks.

An out-of-sample comparison with traditional risk-minimization methods reveals that Hierarchical Risk Parity outperforms in terms of tail risk-adjusted return, thereby working as a potential risk management tool that can help cryptocurrency investors to better manage portfolio risk.

Peer-to-peer bilateral transactions avoid broker fees but involve challenges of balancing between cooperative and competitive strategies for multi-round negotiations. To solve these challenges, this paper develops novel utility-based and adaptive agent-tracking strategies for bilateral negotiations. Relying on bilateral transaction volume and utility curves determined over a price range during unilateral pre-negotiation, utility-based strategies are developed for generation company (GenCo) agent (load serving entity (LSE) agent) to offer (bid) volumes and prices during multi-round bilateral negotiations. GenCo agent is also equipped with a new adaptive agent-tracking strategy that estimates reservation price of each LSE agent by Bayesian learning and updates the estimates in each round. The adaptive agent-tracking strategy facilitates cooperative yet competitive responses. Integration of new bilateral negotiation strategies with existing day-ahead auction in a renowned agent-based platform also enables combined simulation of the two market types. The case study demonstrates that the adaptive agent-tracking strategy empowers GenCoagents to swing bilateral negotiation results in their favor and yield 7% more payoff than the utility-based strategy, while achieving 100% improvement in frequency of failure of negotiation.",Bilateral negotiations Day-ahead markets Peerto-peer; bilateral transactions Machine learning; Heuristic methods Adaptive agents Agent-based models,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Imran, Kashif; Zhang, Jiangfeng; Pal, Anamitra; Khattak, Abraiz; Ullah, Kafait; Baig, Sherjeel Mahmood",,,,,English,,,,,,PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION; OPPONENT; MODEL,"[Imran, Kashif; Khattak, Abraiz; Ullah, Kafait; Baig, Sherjeel Mahmood] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, USPCAS E, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Zhang, Jiangfeng] Clemson Univ, Dept Automot Engn, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Pal, Anamitra] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Clemson University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Imran, K (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, USPCAS E, Islamabad, Pakistan.",ki4kashifimran@gmail.com,"Zhang, Jiangfeng/E-6891-2011; Baig, Sherjeel/HHJ-0751-2022; Khattak, Abraiz/C-3911-2016; Ullah, Kafait/AAI-5856-2020; Zhang, Jiangfeng/R-1197-2018","Ullah, Kafait/0000-0003-1813-9695; Imran, Kashif/0000-0002-9926-297X; Zhang, Jiangfeng/0000-0003-2616-6722; Baig, Sherjeel Mahmood/0000-0002-3259-6334",National University of Sciences and Technology; Arizona State University; University of Strathclyde; Commonwealth Scholarship Commission; USAID,National University of Sciences and Technology; Arizona State University; University of Strathclyde; Commonwealth Scholarship Commission; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Support of National University of Sciences and Technology, Arizona State University and University of Strathclyde is acknowledged.

We apply the random forest method to predict the cross-section of expected excess returns and choose n stocks with the highest monthly predictions. We compare three different techniques—mean-variance, HRP, and 1/N— for portfolio weight creation using returns of stocks from the S&P500 and STOXX600 for robustness. The out-of-sample results show that both mean-variance and HRP optimizers outperform the 1/N rule. This conclusion is in the opposition to a common criticism of optimizers’ efficiency and presents a new light on their potential practical usage. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, in penalty-based portfolio optimization algorithms, the cardinality level of the resultant portfolio relies on the choice of the regularization parameter. This brief formulates the mean-variance model as a cardinality (ℓ0 -norm) constrained nonconvex optimization problem, in which we can explicitly specify the number of assets in the portfolio. We then use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) concept to develop an algorithm to solve the constrained nonconvex problem. Unlike some existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can explicitly control the portfolio cardinality. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the proposed algorithm is derived. Numerical results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 2012 IEEE.",alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs); mean-variance model; sparse portfolio; ℓ<sub>0</sub>-norm,"Functions; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Latexes; Neural networks; Optimization; <inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell_0$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-norm; Alternating direction method of multiplier; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Convex functions; Covariance matrices; Heuristics algorithm; Index; Mean variance model; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Portfolio; Sparse portfolio; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; algorithm; article; Covariance matrix","X.P.

Here, we take a first step towards addressing this challenge by performing a comparison of the widely used classical ML models known as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), against a recently proposed quantum model, now known as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs). Both models address the same hard tasks in unsupervised generative modeling, with QCBMs exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and a candidate for near-term quantum computers, as experimentally demonstrated in three different quantum hardware architectures to date. To address the question of the performance of the quantum model on real-world classical data sets, we construct scenarios from a probabilistic version out of the well-known portfolio optimization problem in finance, by using time-series pricing data from asset subsets of the S&P500 stock market index. It is remarkable to find that, under the same number of resources in terms of parameters for both classical and quantum models, the quantum models seem to have superior performance on typical instances when compared with the canonical training of the RBMs. Our simulations are grounded on a hardware efficient realization of the QCBMs on ion-trap quantum computers, by using their native gate sets, and therefore readily implementable in near-term quantum devices.",quantum finance; quantum machine learning; generative models; unsupervised machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Alcazar, Javier; Leyton-Ortega, Vicente; Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro",,,,,English,,,,,,PORTFOLIO SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION,"[Alcazar, Javier; Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro] Zapata Comp Canada Inc, 1 Yonge St,Suite 900, Toronto, ON M5E 1E5, Canada; [Alcazar, Javier] Natl Australia Bank, 88 Wood St, London EC2V 7QQ, England; [Leyton-Ortega, Vicente] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Comp Sci & Engn Div, One Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Leyton-Ortega, Vicente; Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro] Rigetti Comp, 2919 Seventh St, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA; [Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of London; University College London,"Perdomo-Ortiz, A (corresponding author), Zapata Comp Canada Inc, 1 Yonge St,Suite 900, Toronto, ON M5E 1E5, Canada.; Perdomo-Ortiz, A (corresponding author), Rigetti Comp, 2919 Seventh St, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA.; Perdomo-Ortiz, A (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England.",alejandro@zapatacomputing.com,"Leyton-Ortega, Vicente/GPX-7087-2022; Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro/B-4753-2009","Leyton Ortega, Vicente Ancelmo/0000-0003-4255-9892; Perdomo-Ortiz, Alejandro/0000-0001-7176-4719",ASCR Quantum Testbed Pathfinder Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory under FWP [ERKJ332],ASCR Quantum Testbed Pathfinder Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory under FWP,"The authors would like to acknowledge Marcello Benedetti, Dax Koh, and Yudong Cao for useful feedback on an early version of this manuscript.

Here, we take a first step towards addressing this challenge by performing a comparison of the widely used classical ML models known as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), against a recently proposed quantum model, now known as quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs). Both models address the same hard tasks in unsupervised generative modeling, with QCBMs exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and a candidate for near-term quantum computers, as experimentally demonstrated in three different quantum hardware architectures to date. To address the question of the performance of the quantum model on real-world classical data sets, we construct scenarios from a probabilistic version out of the well-known portfolio optimization problem in finance, by using time-series pricing data from asset subsets of the S&P500 stock market index. It is remarkable to find that, under the same number of resources in terms of parameters for both classical and quantum models, the quantum models seem to have superior performance on typical instances when compared with the canonical training of the RBMs. Our simulations are grounded on a hardware efficient realization of the QCBMs on ion-trap quantum computers, by using their native gate sets, and therefore readily implementable in near-term quantum devices. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the majority of the previous work has been dedicated to systems with discrete action spaces. To address the challenge of continuous action and multi-dimensional state spaces, we propose the so called Stacked Deep Dynamic Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (SDDRRL) architecture to construct a real-time optimal portfolio. The algorithm captures the up-to-date market conditions and rebalances the portfolio accordingly. Under this general vision, Sharpe ratio, which is one of the most widely accepted measures of risk-adjusted returns, has been used as a performance metric. Additionally, the performance of most machine learning algorithms highly depends on their hyperparameter settings. Therefore, we equipped SDDRRL with the ability to find the best possible architecture topology using an automated Gaussian Process (GP) with Expected Improvement (EI) as an acquisition function. This allows us to select the best architectures that maximizes the total return while respecting the cardinality constraints. Finally, our system was trained and tested in an online manner for 20 successive rounds with data for ten selected stocks from different sectors of the S&P 500 from January 1st, 2013 to July 31st, 2017. The experiments reveal that the proposed SDDRRL achieves superior performance compared to three benchmarks: the rolling horizon Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) model, the rolling horizon risk parity model, and the uniform buy-and-hold (UBAH) index. © 2019",Deep learning; Financial time series; Policy gradient; Portfolio management; Reinforcement learning; Sequential model-based optimization; Trading systems,Benchmarking; Commerce; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Reinforcement learning; Risk assessment; Financial time series; Policy gradient; Portfolio managements; Sequential model; Trading systems; Machine learning,"C.-G.

The underlying asset portfolio process is assumed to possess a continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain structure involving the simplex and ergodicity constraints. The goal of the portfolio problem is the redistribution of a fund into different financial assets. One general assumption has to be set, namely that the market is arbitrage-free (no price arbitrage is possible) then the problem of how to obtain the optimal policy is solvable. We provide a RL solution based on an actor/critic architecture in which the market is characterized by a restriction called transaction cost, involving time penalization. The portfolio problem in Markov chains is determined by solving a convex quadratic minimization problem with linear constraints. Any Markov chain is generated by a stochastic transition matrices and the mathematical expectations of the rewards. In particular, we estimate the elements of the transition rate matrices and the mathematical expectations of the rewards. This method learns the optimal strategy in order to make a decision on what portfolio weight to take for a single period. With this strategy, the agent is able to choose the state with maximum utility and select its respective action. The optimal policy computation is solved employing a proximal optimization novel approach, which involves time penalization in the transaction costs and the rewards. We employ the Lagrange multipliers approach to include the restrictions of the market and those that are imposed by the continuous time frame. Moreover, a specific numerical example in baking, that fit into the general framework of portfolio, validates the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Continuous-time; Markov chains; Portfolio; Reinforcement learning; Transaction costs,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Financial data processing; Investments; Lagrange multipliers; Machine learning; Markov processes; Matrix algebra; Numerical methods; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Continuous-time; Lagrange multipliers approaches; Markov chain structure; Mathematical expectation; Portfolio; Reinforcement learning approach; Stochastic transitions; Transaction cost; Financial markets,"J.B.

Novel AI applications have been already proposed to deal with challenges in the areas of credit scoring, risk assessment, client experience and portfolio management. One of the most critical challenges in the aforementioned sector is fraud detection upon streams of transactions. Recently, deep learning models have been introduced to deal with the specific problem in terms of detecting and forecasting possible fraudulent events. The aim is to estimate the unknown distribution of normal/fraudulent transactions and then to identify deviations that may indicate a potential fraud. In this paper, we elaborate on a novel multistage deep learning model that targets to efficiently manage the incoming streams of transactions and detect the fraudulent ones. We propose the use of two autoencoders to perform feature selection and learn the latent data space representation based on a nonlinear optimization model. On the delivered significant features, we subsequently apply a deep convolutional neural network to detect frauds, thus combining two different processing blocks. The adopted combination has the goal of detecting frauds over the exposed latent data representation and not over the initial data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Autoencoder (AE); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Dimensionality reduction; Fraud detection; Oversampling techniques; Variational autoencoder (VAE),Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Investments; Nonlinear programming; Risk assessment; Variational techniques; Auto encoders; Autoencoder; Convolutional neural network; Dimensionality reduction; Fraud detection; Learning models; Oversampling technique; Variational autoencoder; Crime,"G.

These assets are not independent but correlated during a short time period. A graph convolutional reinforcement learning framework called DeepPocket is proposed whose objective is to exploit the time-varying interrelations between financial instruments. These interrelations are represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to the financial instruments while the edges correspond to a pair-wise correlation function in between assets. DeepPocket consists of a restricted, stacked autoencoder for feature extraction, a convolutional network to collect underlying local information shared among financial instruments and an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent. The actor-critic structure contains two convolutional networks in which the actor learns and enforces an investment policy which is, in turn, evaluated by the critic in order to determine the best course of action by constantly reallocating the various portfolio assets to optimize the expected return on investment. The agent is initially trained offline with online stochastic batching on historical data. As new data become available, it is trained online with a passive concept drift approach to handle unexpected changes in their distributions. DeepPocket is evaluated against five real-life datasets over three distinct investment periods, including during the Covid-19 crisis, and clearly outperformed market indexes. © 2021",Actor-critic; Deep reinforcement learning; Graph convolutional network; Online leaning; Portfolio management; Restricted stacked autoencoder,Convolution; Deep learning; Financial data processing; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Actor critic; Convolutional networks; Financial portfolio; Graph convolutional network; Online leaning; Portfolio managements; Reinforcement learnings; Restricted stacked autoencoder; Returns on investment; Time-periods; Investments,"E.

We discuss how standard reinforcement learning methods can be applied to non-linear reward structures, i.e. in our case convex risk measures. As a general contribution to the use of deep learning for stochastic processes, we also show in Section 4 that the set of constrained trading strategies used by our algorithm is large enough to ε-approximate any optimal solution. Our algorithm can be implemented efficiently even in high-dimensional situations using modern machine learning tools. Its structure does not depend on specific market dynamics, and generalizes across hedging instruments including the use of liquid derivatives. Its computational performance is largely invariant in the size of the portfolio as it depends mainly on the number of hedging instruments available. We illustrate our approach by an experiment on the S&P500 index and by showing the effect on hedging under transaction costs in a synthetic market driven by the Heston model, where we outperform the standard ‘complete-market’ solution. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Hedging; Machine learning; Market frictions; Portfolio optimization; Reinforcement learning; Risk management; Transaction costs,,"L.

The framework they present circumvents the requirements for forecasting expected returns and allows them to directly optimize portfolio weights by updating model parameters. Instead of selecting individual assets, they trade exchange-traded funds of market indexes to form a portfolio. Indexes of different asset classes show robust correlations, and trading them substantially reduces the spectrum of available assets from which to choose. The authors compare their method with a wide range of algorithms, with results showing that the model obtains the best performance over the testing period of 2011 to the end of April 2020, including the financial instabilities of the first quarter of 2020. A sensitivity analysis is included to clarify the relevance of input features, and the authors further study the performance of their approach under different cost rates and different risk levels via volatility scaling. © 2020, With intelligence.

This systematic survey explores various scenarios employing deep learning in financial markets, especially the stock market. A key requirement for our methodology is its focus on research papers involving backtesting. That is, we consider whether the experimentation mode is sufficient for market practitioners to consider the work in a real-world use case. Works meeting this requirement are distributed across seven distinct specializations. Most studies focus on trade strategy, price prediction, and portfolio management, with a limited number considering market simulation, stock selection, hedging strategy, and risk management. We also recognize that domain-specific metrics such as “returns” and “volatility” appear most important for accurately representing model performance across specializations. Our study demonstrates that, although there have been some improvements in reproducibility, substantial work remains to be done regarding model explainability. Accordingly, we suggest several future directions, such as improving trust by creating reproducible, explainable, and accountable models and emphasizing prediction of longer-term horizons—potentially via the utilization of supplementary data—which continues to represent a significant unresolved challenge. © 2022, The Author(s).",Backtesting; Deep learning; Financial market; Machine learning; Neural network; Practice and application; Quantitative analysis; Stock market,Commerce; Deep learning; Financial data processing; Investments; Learning systems; Risk management; Surveys; Backtesting; Deep learning; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Practice and application; Price prediction; Real-world; Research papers; Specialisation; Trade strategies; Financial markets,"H.

We propose a deep neural network (DNN) architecture to describe the underlying control process. The DNN consists of K subnetworks, where K is the total number of decision steps. The feedback control function is determined solely by the network parameters. In this way, the multiperiod portfolio optimization problem is linked to a training problem of the DNN, that can be efficiently computed by the standard optimization techniques for network training. We offer a sufficient condition for the algorithm to converge for a general utility function and general asset return dynamics including serially dependent returns. Specifically, under the condition that the global minimum of the DNN training problem is attained, we prove that the algorithm converges with the quadratic utility function when the risky asset returns jointly follow multivariate autoregressive (1) models and/or multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1,1) models. Numerical examples demonstrate the superior performance of the DNN algorithm in various return dynamics for a high-dimensional portfolio (up to 100 dimensions). © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Copyright © by SIAM.",Deep-learning; GARCH; High-dimensionality; Monte Carlo simulation; Neural network; Portfolio optimization; Utility maximization,,"H.Y.

Investor sentiment remained a mystery and challenge over time, inviting researchers to comprehend the market trends. The entry of behavioral scientists in and around the 1980s brought in the market trading’s human dimensions. Shortly after that, due to the digitization of exchanges, the mix of traders changed as institutional traders started using algorithmic trading (AT) on computers. Nevertheless, the effects of investor sentiment did not disappear and continued to intrigue market researchers. Though market sentiment plays a significant role in timing investment decisions, classical finance models largely ignored the role of investor sentiment in asset pricing. For knowing if the market price is value-driven, the investor would isolate components of irrationality from the price, as reflected in the sentiment. Investor sentiment is an expression of irrational expectations of a stock’s risk-return profile that is not justified by available information. In this context, the paper aims to predict the next-day trend in the index prices for the centralized Indian National Stock Exchange (NSE) deploying machine learning algorithms like support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks. The training set is historical NSE closing price data from June 1st, 2013-June 30th, 2020. Additionally, the authors factor technical indicators like moving average (MA), moving average convergence-divergence (MACD), K (%) oscillator and corresponding three days moving average D (%), relative strength indicator (RSI) value, and the LW (R%) indicator for the same period. The predictive power of deep neural networks over other machine learning techniques is established in the paper, demonstrating the future scope of deep learning in multi-parameter time series prediction. © 2021 IGI Global.

This problem is especially important in cryptocurrency markets, which already support the trading of hundreds of assets with new ones being added every month. A novel neural network architecture is proposed, which is trained using deep reinforcement learning. Our architecture considers all assets in the market, and automatically adapts when new ones are suddenly introduced, making our method more general and sample-efficient than previous methods. Further, transaction cost minimization is considered when formulating the problem. For this purpose, a novel algorithm to compute optimal transactions given a desired portfolio is integrated into the architecture. The proposed method was tested on a dataset of one of the largest cryptocurrency markets in the world, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving average daily returns of over 24%. © 2020",Deep learning; Multiple assets; Portfolio management; Reinforcement learning; Transaction costs,Cryptocurrency; Electronic trading; Investments; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Novel algorithm; Novel neural network; Portfolio managements; State-of-the-art methods; Transaction cost; Deep learning,"C.

Traditionally, researchers in the financial market have utilized the modern portfolio theory for portfolio optimization; however, with the recent development of artificial intelligence, attempts to optimize portfolios with reinforcement learning are increasing. Many studies have developed reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms and conducted portfolio optimization research. However, in reality, thus far, the securities industry thus has used the modern portfolio theory, which is sufficiently valuable. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be an attempt to combine modern portfolio theory and reinforcement learning. To bridge this gap in the literature, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that combines the modern portfolio theory and a deep learning approach. As far as we know, we are the first to combine recent deep learning technology and traditional financial theory. Specifically, we solved the multimodal problem through the Tucker decomposition of a model with the input of technical analysis and stock return covariates. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the Sharpe ratio, annualized return, and maximum drawdown. In addition, the proposed method dynamically changes the weight according to the market trend, unlike other state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Deep reinforcement learning; Modern portfolio theory; Portfolio management; Technical analysis; Tensor decomposition,Commerce; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Data quality; Deep reinforcement learning; Modern portfolio theories; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimization; Reinforcement learnings; State-of-the-art algorithms; Stock portfolio; Technical analysis; Tensor decomposition; Reinforcement learning,"N.

In this article, the authors investigate the use of machine learning techniques to predict defaults for commercial real estate property loans. The authors assess the performance of classification techniques based on machine learning (support vector machine, random forest, boosting, and classification tree) compared to the performance of the typical statistical technique. The principal findings of this study are that the support vector machine technique for predicting defaults on commercial property loans significantly outperforms other methods, and it has stable performance in imbalanced datasets.

These markets exhibit linear as well as nonlinear features and Conventional forecasting methods partially succeed in dealing with the nonlinear nature of stock returns. Contrarily, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a flexible machine learning tool which caters both the linear and nonlinear markets. This paper investigates the forecasting ability of ANN by using Fama and French five-factor model. We construct ANN’s based on the composite factors of the FF5F model to predict portfolio returns in two stages; in stage one, the study identifies the best-fit combination of training, testing, and validation along with the number of neurons full sample period. In stage two, the study uses this best combination to forecast the model under 48-months rolling window analysis. In-sample and out-sample comparisons, regression, and goodness of fit test and actual and predicted values of the stock returns of our ANN model reveal that the proposed model accurately predicts the one-month ahead returns. Our findings reinforce the investment concept that the markets compensate the high-risk portfolios more than mid and low beta portfolios and the methodology will significantly improve the return on investment of the investors. © 2019 The Author(s).",Artificial neural networks; Asset pricing models; Fama and French 5 Factors CAPM; Forecasting; Stock markets,,"M.N.

Optimal portfolios constructed aim to have a minimal risk with highest accompanying investment returns, regardless of market conditions. This paper focuses on providing an alternative view in maximising portfolio returns using Reinforcement Learning (RL) by considering dynamic risks appropriate to market conditions through dynamic portfolio rebalancing. The proposed algorithm is able to improve portfolio management by introducing the dynamic rebalancing of portfolios with vigorous risk through an RL agent. This is done while accounting for market conditions, asset diversifications, risk and returns in the global financial market. Studies have been performed in this paper to explore four types of methods with variations in fully portfolio rebalancing and gradual portfolio rebalancing, which combine with and without the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices for adjusting the technical indicator centring. Performances of the four methods have been evaluated and compared using three constructed financial portfolios, including one portfolio with global market index assets with different risk levels, and two portfolios with uncorrelated stock assets from different sectors and risk levels. Observed from the experiment results, the proposed RL agent for gradual portfolio rebalancing with the LSTM model on price prediction outperforms the other three methods, as well as returns of individual assets in these three portfolios. The improvements of the returns using the RL agent for gradual rebalancing with prediction model are achieved at about 27.9–93.4% over those of the full rebalancing without prediction model. It has demonstrated the ability to dynamically adjust portfolio compositions according to the market trends, risks and returns of the global indices and stock assets. © 2021, The Author(s).",Dynamic portfolio rebalancing; Portfolio optimisation; Price prediction; Reinforcement learning,Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; International trade; Investments; Long short-term memory; Risk management; Dynamic portfolio rebalancing; Dynamic portfolios; Market condition; Memory modeling; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimization; Price prediction; Rebalancing; Reinforcement learning agent; Risk levels; Reinforcement learning,"Q.

In this paper, we propose two stock trading decision-making methods. First, we propose a nested reinforcement learning (Nested RL) method based on three deep reinforcement learning models (the Advantage Actor Critic, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and Soft Actor Critic models) that adopts an integration strategy by nesting reinforcement learning on the basic decision-maker. Thus, this strategy can dynamically select agents according to the current situation to generate trading decisions made under different market environments. Second, to inherit the advantages of three basic decision-makers, we consider confidence and propose a weight random selection with confidence (WRSC) strategy. In this way, investors can gain more profits by integrating the advantages of all agents. All the algorithms are validated for the U.S., Japanese and British stocks and evaluated by different performance indicators. The experimental results show that the annualized return, cumulative return, and Sharpe ratio values of our ensemble strategy are higher than those of the baselines, which indicates that our nested RL and WRSC methods can assist investors in their portfolio management with more profits under the same level of investment risk. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deep reinforcement learning; Investment market; Real-time decision-making; Stock trading,Commerce; Decision making; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Learning systems; Profitability; Decision makers; Deep reinforcement learning; Ensemble strategies; Investment market; Random selection; Real time decision-making; Real-time decision making; Reinforcement learnings; Stock trading; Trading agent; Reinforcement learning,"X.

The energy sector was heavily affected and resulted in energy prices massively tumbling. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fueled the energy maker more volatile. In such uncertain contexts, an Early Warning System (EWS) would efficiently contribute to stabilizing market swings. It will leverage the ability to control operating costs and pave the way for smooth economic recovery. Within this framework, we deploy Machine Learning (ML) models to forecast energy equity prices by employing uncertainty indices as a proxy for predicting energy market volatility. We empirically examine the comparative effectiveness of prevalent ML models and conventional approaches (regression) to forecast the energy equity prices by utilizing the daily data from 1/6/2011 to 18/1/2022 for four US uncertainty and eight energy equity indices. Results show that the Nonlinear Autoregressive with External (Exogenous) parameters (NARX) of Neural Networks (NN) scored significantly better accuracy than all other (25) ML models and conventional approaches. The study outcomes are beneficial for policymakers, governments, market regulators, investors, hedge and mutual funds, and corporations. They improve stakeholders' resilience to exogenous shocks, blaze the recovery path, and provide evidence-based for assets allocation strategies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19; Early warning systems; Energy equity prices; Forecasting; Machine learning; United States,,"M.M.

In this study, with stock return and risk as indicators of firm performance, we investigate how DPS investment affects the financial performance of BDA firms (firms with BDA investment) and non-BDA firms (firms without BDA investment). We use a difference-in-differences approach and apply the propensity score matching to 1400 DPS announcements made by 228 US firms whose stocks are publicly traded on US stock markets from 2004 to 2018. The main findings are as follows: (1) On average, DPS investment significantly reduces firms' systematic risk. (2) The risk reduction effects are greater for non-BDA firms than for BDA firms. Our results indicate that DPS investment reduces firm risk and that the business value of specific information technology (IT) investment (e.g., DPS) is influenced by firms' other IT assets (e.g., BDA).

Compared to a linear benchmark model, interactions and nonlinear effects help improve the predictive performance. But machine learning models must be adequately trained and tuned to overcome the high dimensionality problem and to avoid overfitting. Across all machine learning methods, the most important predictors are based on price trends and fundamental signals from valuation ratios. However, the models exhibit substantial variation in statistical predictive performance that translate into pronounced differences in economic profitability. The return and risk measures of long-only trading strategies indicate that machine learning models produce sizeable gains relative to our benchmark. Neural networks perform best, also after accounting for transaction costs. A classification-based portfolio formation, utilizing a support vector machine that avoids estimating stock-level expected returns, performs even better than the neural network architecture. © 2021, The Author(s).",Active trading strategy; Machine learning; Stock return prediction,,"T.

Cryptocurrency trade constitutes a constantly increasing financial market and a promising type of profitable investment; however, it is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. Therefore, the development of an intelligent forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio optimization and decision making. The main contribution of this research is the combination of three of the most widely employed ensemble learning strategies: ensemble-averaging, bagging and stacking with advanced deep learning models for forecasting major cryptocurrency hourly prices. The proposed ensemble models were evaluated utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models as component learners, which were comprised by combinations of long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM and convolutional layers. The ensemble models were evaluated on prediction of the cryptocurrency price on the following hour (regression) and also on the prediction if the price on the following hour will increase or decrease with respect to the current price (classification). Additionally, the reliability of each forecasting model and the efficiency of its predictions is evaluated by examining for autocorrelation of the errors. Our detailed experimental analysis indicates that ensemble learning and deep learning can be efficiently beneficial to each other, for developing strong, stable, and reliable forecasting models.",deep learning; ensemble learning; convolutional networks; long short-term memory; cryptocurrency; time-series,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Livieris, Ioannis E.; Pintelas, Emmanuel; Stavroyiannis, Stavros; Pintelas, Panagiotis",,,,,English,,,,,,NEURAL-NETWORKS,"[Livieris, Ioannis E.; Pintelas, Emmanuel; Pintelas, Panagiotis] Univ Patras, Dept Math, GR-26500 Patras, Greece; [Stavroyiannis, Stavros] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Accounting & Finance, GR-24100 Antikalamos, Greece",University of Patras,"Livieris, IE (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Math, GR-26500 Patras, Greece.",livieris@upatras.gr; ece6835@upnet.gr; computmath@gmail.com; ppintelas@gmail.com,"Pintelas, Panagiotis/AAB-4906-2020; Stavroyiannis, Stavros/Q-7148-2019","Livieris, Ioannis/0000-0002-3996-3301; Stavroyiannis, Stavros/0000-0001-8444-9371",,,,"Aha D.W, 2013, Lazy Learning; [Anonymous], 2018, TIME SERIES PREDICTI; Azoff E.M., 1994, Neural Network Time Series Forecasting of Financial Markets; Bian S., 2007, INT J HYBRID INTELLI, V4, P103, DOI DOI 10.3233/HIS-2007-4204; Breiman L., 2017, CLASSIFICATION REGRE, DOI [DOI 10.1201/9781315139470-8, DOI 10.1201/9781315139470]; Brockwell PJ, 2016, SPRINGER TEXTS STAT, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-29854-2; Christiansen B, 2018, J CLIMATE, V31, P1587, DOI 10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0197.1; De Luca G, 2004, SKEW-ELLIPTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS: A JOURNEY BEYOND NORMALITY, P205; De Luca G, 2015, EUR J FINANC, V21, P1113, DOI 10.1080/1351847X.2011.640342; Deng N., 2012, Support vector machines: Optimization based theory, algorithms, and extensions; Elisseeff A, 2005, J MACH LEARN RES, V6, P55; Grandvalet Y, 2004, MACH LEARN, V55, P251, DOI 10.1023/B:MACH.0000027783.34431.42; Graves A, 2012, STUD COMPUT INTELL, V385, P1, DOI [10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735, 10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.1, 10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2]; Graves A, 2013, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P6645, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638947; Gulli A., 2017, Deep Learning with Keras; Ioffe Sergey, 2015, P MACHINE LEARNING R, V37, P448, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1502.03167; Ji SW, 2019, MATHEMATICS-BASEL, V7, DOI 10.3390/math7100898; Kingma DP., 2014, ARXIV, V1412, P6980, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1412.6980; Kotsiantis SB, 2014, KNOWL ENG REV, V29, P78, DOI 10.1017/S0269888913000313; Kumar D, 2020, NUTRIENT DYNAMICS FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION, P103, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-8660-2_4; Kutner M.H., 2005, Applied linear statistical models, V5; Lior R, 2019, ENSEMBLE LEARNING PA, V85; Livieris I.E, NEURAL COMPUT APPL; Livieris IE, 2021, EVOL SYST-GER, V12, P155, DOI 10.1007/s12530-019-09324-2; Lu L, 2019, DEEP LEARNING CONVOL; McNally S, 2018, EUROMICRO WORKSHOP P, P339, DOI 10.1109/PDP2018.2018.00060; Michelucci U., 2019, Advanced Applied Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks and Object Detection, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4842-4976-5; Miura R, 2019, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V11554, P165, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-22796-8_18; Nakamoto S., 2008, Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.; Nakano M, 2018, PHYSICA A, V510, P587, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2018.07.017; Nowak J, 2017, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V10246, P553, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-59060-8_50; Oancea B, ARXIV14011333; Pintelas E., 2020, 16 INT C ART INT APP; Pintelas P., 2020, FUNDAMENTAL RES QUES; Polikar R, 2012, ENSEMBLE MACHINE LEARNING: METHODS AND APPLICATIONS, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-9326-7_1; Rahman L, 2016, INT CONF ELECTR ENG; Rawat W, 2017, NEURAL COMPUT, V29, P2352, DOI [10.1162/NECO_a_00990, 10.1162/neco_a_00990]; Rokach L., 2010, Ensemble learning: pattern classification using ensemble methods, V75; Schuster M, 1997, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V45, P2673, DOI 10.1109/78.650093; Shintate T, 2019, J RISK FINANC MANAG, V12, DOI 10.3390/jrfm12010017; Shuanglong Liu, 2017, Neural Information Processing. 24th International Conference, ICONIP 2017.

Cryptocurrency trade constitutes a constantly increasing financial market and a promising type of profitable investment; however, it is characterized by high volatility and strong fluctuations of prices over time. Therefore, the development of an intelligent forecasting model is considered essential for portfolio optimization and decision making. The main contribution of this research is the combination of three of the most widely employed ensemble learning strategies: ensemble-averaging, bagging and stacking with advanced deep learning models for forecasting major cryptocurrency hourly prices. The proposed ensemble models were evaluated utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models as component learners, which were comprised by combinations of long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM and convolutional layers. The ensemble models were evaluated on prediction of the cryptocurrency price on the following hour (regression) and also on the prediction if the price on the following hour will increase or decrease with respect to the current price (classification). Additionally, the reliability of each forecasting model and the efficiency of its predictions is evaluated by examining for autocorrelation of the errors.

Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, 1000, North Macedonia","Rapid technological developments in the last decade have contributed to using machine learning (ML) in various economic sectors. Financial institutions have embraced technology and have applied ML algorithms in trading, portfolio management, and investment advising. Large-scale automation capabilities and cost savings make the ML algorithms attractive for personal and corporate finance applications. Using ML applications in finance raises ethical issues that need to be carefully examined. We engage a group of experts in finance and ethics to evaluate the relationship between ethical principles of finance and ML. The paper compares the experts’ findings with the results obtained using natural language processing (NLP) transformer models, given their ability to capture the semantic text similarity. The results reveal that the finance principles of integrity and fairness have the most significant relationships with ML ethics. The study includes a use case with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Microsoft Responsible AI Widgets explainability tools for error analysis and visualization of ML models. It analyzes credit card approval data and demonstrates that the explainability tools can address ethical issues in fintech, and improve transparency, thereby increasing the overall trustworthiness of ML models. The results show that both humans and machines could err in approving credit card requests despite using their best judgment based on the available information. Hence, human-machine collaboration could contribute to improved decision-making in finance. We propose a conceptual framework for addressing ethical challenges in fintech such as bias, discrimination, differential pricing, conflict of interest, and data protection. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

In contrast, the novel approach introduced in this study constructs a topographical map demarcating the relative importance, dispersion, and interrelationship among many finance topics. The final product is a bird's eye view of the whole literature illustrating historical trends, concentrations, and territories. We apply qualitative analysis, purposive sampling, and syntactic analysis to 34,261 articles published in 52 journals over the past two decades. First, we analyze the proliferation and historical development of topics. We find that a few topics (e.g., insurance) are losing ground to newer ones (e.g., blockchain and digital currency). However, several topics seem to occupy a stable, sizeable portion of finance literature (e.g., investment strategies and portfolio management). Next, we analyze the relationship between topics and journals and report strong tendencies that are not always confined by the traditional scope of journals. For instance, papers addressing investment strategy and portfolio management issues seem to appear in numerous journals; while special topics such as blockchain, digital currencies, dividends, and real estate can only be found in a limited number of journals. We also report strong interdependence among topics. More than a third of the papers screened in this study discuss two topics or more. We identify a list of topics that are likely to be investigated jointly. Overall, our work demonstrates the historical evolution of the entire finance literature; and identifies fertile areas for future research.",Finance; Literature review; Qualitative analysis; Purposive sampling; Topographical map,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Alhenawi, Yasser; Hassan, M.

Using a variety of vector autoregressive models, the investor is able, each period, to learn about important data features. The developed methodology synthesizes a wide array of established approaches for modeling exchange rate dynamics. In a thorough investigation of monthly exchange rate predictability for 10 countries, we find that using the proposed methodology for dynamic asset allocation achieves substantial economic gains out of sample. In particular, we find evidence for sparsity, fast model switching, and exploitation of the exchange rate cross-section. © 2020 The Authors.

We define a market state with recurrent neural network (RNN) volatility predictions and construct an investment strategy that dynamically combines equity, cash, and safe havens. The equity is allocated by targeting the volatility, and investing in safe havens depends on the predicted market state. We consider the S&P500 index with 13 safe haven assets, such as long-term government bonds, commodities, gold, and other precious metals. Other indices, NIKKEI225, NIFTY50, and STOXX50, are examined for robustness. With analysis conducted over a 20-year sample period, we find that RNN delivers sound predictions to construct the volatility targeting strategy. Among considered assets, only long-term Treasury bonds act as a safe haven and improve the strategy performance. Other considered assets have no such potential. Our findings are relevant to portfolio managers and investors actively managing portfolio risk. © 2021 The Author(s)",Asset allocation strategy; Machine Learning; Recurrent neural networks; Safe haven; Target volatility,,"T.

In this paper, a portfolio management framework is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning framework called DeepBreath. The DeepBreath methodology combines a restricted stacked autoencoder and a convolutional neural network (CNN) into an integrated framework. The restricted stacked autoencoder is employed in order to conduct dimensionality reduction and features selection, thus ensuring that only the most informative abstract features are retained. The CNN is used to learn and enforce the investment policy which consists of reallocating the various assets in order to increase the expected return on investment. The framework consists of both offline and online learning strategies: the former is required to train the CNN while the latter handles concept drifts i.e. a change in the data distribution resulting from unforeseen circumstances. These are based on passive concept drift detection and online stochastic batching. Settlement risk may occur as a result of a delay in between the acquisition of an asset and its payment failing to deliver the terms of a contract. In order to tackle this challenging issue, a blockchain is employed. Finally, the performance of the DeepBreath framework is tested with four test sets over three distinct investment periods. The results show that the return of investment achieved by our approach outperforms current expert investment strategies while minimizing the market risk. © 2020",Blockchain; Deep reinforcement learning; Online leaning; Portfolio management; Restricted stacked autoencoder; Settlement risk,Convolutional neural networks; Dimensionality reduction; E-learning; Financial data processing; Investments; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Financial portfolio; Integrated frameworks; Investment periods; Investment policies; Investment strategy; Online learning strategy; Portfolio managements; Return of investments; Deep learning,"E.

These strategies are in turn implemented through specific action plans, assuring the coherence and alignment between the different strategic hierarchical levels, beginning with business strategy, through category strategy to specific tactical sourcing levers. The proposed framework is the result of a longitudinal study executed through two action research cycles engaging in a strategic sourcing project in a leading European specialty steels manufacturer. By integrating and refining in our framework three dominant purchasing portfolio models - i.e. Kraljic, Olsen & Ellram, and Scott & Westbrook - we highlight the importance of adopting multiple perspectives to manage the complexity of formulating a purchasing strategy and its related implementation decisions. The proposed framework has been designed to facilitate dynamic learning mechanisms through a feedback loop to continuously update the three integrated models and in turn allow managers to gain a strategic perspective of the evolution of buyer-supplier relationships, the influence of previous decisions and external factors. A critical discussion explores the proposed solution through the main theoretical lenses emerged throughout the research process. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Action research; Portfolio management; Purchasing strategy; Strategic sourcing,,"M.

Accurate Bitcoin price direction forecasts are important for determining the trend in Bitcoin prices and asset allocation. This paper addresses several unanswered questions. How important are business cycle variables like interest rates, inflation, and market volatility for forecasting Bitcoin prices? Does the importance of these variables change across time? Are the most important macroeconomic variables for forecasting Bitcoin prices the same as those for gold prices? To answer these questions, we utilize tree-based machine learning classifiers, along with traditional logit econometric models. The analysis reveals several important findings. First, random forests predict Bitcoin and gold price directions with a higher degree of accuracy than logit models. Prediction accuracy for bagging and random forests is between 75% and 80% for a five-day prediction. For 10-day to 20-day forecasts bagging and random forests record accuracies greater than 85%. Second, technical indicators are the most important features for predicting Bitcoin and gold price direction, suggesting some degree of market inefficiency. Third, oil price volatility is important for predicting Bitcoin and gold prices indicating that Bitcoin is a substitute for gold in diversifying this type of volatility. By comparison, gold prices are more influenced by inflation than Bitcoin prices, indicating that gold can be used as a hedge or diversification asset against inflation.",Forecasting; Machine learning;

These techniques have been widely applied in finance for stock market prediction, portfolio optimization, risk management, and trading strategies. Forecasting stock indices with noisy data is a complex and challenging task, but it plays an important role in the appropriate timing of buying or selling stocks, which is one of the most popular and valuable areas in finance. In this work, we propose novel hybrid models for forecasting the one-time-step and multi-time-step close prices of DAX, DOW, and S&P500 indices by utilizing recurrent neural network (RNN)–based models; convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU)-CNN, and ensemble models. We propose the averaging of the high and low prices of stock market indices as a novel feature. The experimental results confirmed that our models outperformed the traditional machine-learning models in 48.1% and 40.7% of the cases in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, in the case of one-time-step forecasting and 81.5% of the cases in terms of the MSE and MAE in the case of multi-time-step forecasting. © 2023 by the authors.",convolutional neural networks; deep learning; ensemble model; feature engineering; gated recurrent unit; long short-term memory; recurrent neural networks,,"H.

Most of existing studies assumed that the investor has all the cash in hand and no securities position before portfolio optimization, which is sometimes inconsistent to reality. Besides, many studies are based on expected utility theory, which is in conflict with the behavior of some investors and may also lead to over-concentration of capital. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy portfolio selection model based on three-way decision and cumulative prospect theory, which can mitigate the two shortcomings mentioned above. In this model, every action in the action set to the candidate securities is assigned to a prospect value and we can construct a tri-partition of the candidate securities according to three-way decision theory. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we adopted two case studies on the basis of real market data. The experimented results prove that the using of three-way decision and cumulative prospect theory increases the investment return, meanwhile, reduces the risk for the investor.",Fuzzy portfolio selection; Three-way decision; Cumulative prospect theory; Expected utility theory,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Wang, Xianhe; Wang, Bo; Liu, Shu; Li, Huaxiong; Wang, Tianxing; Watada, Junzo",,,,,English,,,,,,EXPECTED UTILITY; MODELS,"[Wang, Xianhe; Wang, Bo; Li, Huaxiong; Wang, Tianxing] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shu] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China; [Watada, Junzo] Waseda Univ, Sch Informat Prod & Syst, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan",Nanjing University; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Waseda University,"Wang, B (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",thisiswangxianhe@gmail.com; bowangsme@nju.edu.cn; liushusue65@gmail.com; huaxiongli@nju.edu.cn; wangtianxing@smail.nju.edu.cn; junzow@osb.att.ne.jp,"Watada, Junzo/JWO-8968-2024; Li, Huaxiong/AAR-8881-2020; Wang, Bo/A-7073-2012","Xianhe, WANG/0000-0002-0344-4200",,,,"Carlsson C, 2002, FUZZY SET SYST, V131, P13, DOI 10.1016/S0165-0114(01)00251-2; Chang JH, 2020, J COMPUT APPL MATH, V377, DOI 10.1016/j.cam.2020.112892; Chen LH, 2009, EXPERT SYST APPL, V36, P3720, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2008.02.027; Chen W, 2010, PHYSICA A, V389, P2070, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2010.01.016; DONG WM, 1987, FUZZY SET SYST, V21, P183, DOI 10.1016/0165-0114(87)90163-1; Fahrenwaldt MA, 2020, INSUR MATH ECON, V93, P301, DOI 10.1016/j.insmatheco.2020.05.010; Gao Y, 2020, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V87, DOI 10.1016/j.engappai.2019.103276; Guan H, 2019, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V186, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2019.104958; Häckel B, 2017, ENERG POLICY, V111, P414, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.026; Hakli H, 2020, INT J MACH LEARN CYB, V11, P2051, DOI 10.1007/s13042-020-01094-7; Huang XX, 2008, J COMPUT APPL MATH, V217, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.cam.2007.06.009; Huang XX, 2008, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V16, P1096, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924200; Jia XY, 2019, INFORM SCIENCES, V485, P248, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2019.01.067; Jorion P., 1997, VALUE RISK NEW BENCH; KAHNEMAN D, 1979, ECONOMETRICA, V47, P263, DOI 10.2307/1914185; Kairies-Schwarz N, 2017, J ECON BEHAV ORGAN, V137, P374, DOI 10.1016/j.jebo.2017.03.012; Katagiri H, 2014, INT J MACH LEARN CYB, V5, P211, DOI 10.1007/s13042-012-0126-4; Li B, 2014, ACM COMPUT SURV, V46, DOI 10.1145/2512962; Li HQ, 2019, EXPERT SYST APPL, V133, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2019.05.008; Li HX, 2016, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V91, P241, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2015.07.040; Li JH, 2017, INFORM SCIENCES, V378, P244, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2016.04.051; Liu BD, 1998, FUZZY SET SYST, V94, P227, DOI 10.1016/S0165-0114(96)00236-9; Liu BD, 2002, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V10, P445, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.800692; Liu D, 2020, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V191, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105243; Liu WB, 2021, INT J MACH LEARN CYB, V12, P529, DOI 10.1007/s13042-020-01186-4; Mansour N, 2019, EXPERT SYST APPL, V138, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2019.07.027; Markowitz H, 1952, J FINANC, V7, P77, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x; Mehlawat MK, 2020, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V28, P2726, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2020.2969406; QUIGGIN J, 1982, J ECON BEHAV ORGAN, V3, P323, DOI 10.1016/0167-2681(82)90008-7; SCHMEIDLER D, 1989, ECONOMETRICA, V57, P571, DOI 10.2307/1911053; Tanaka H, 2000, FUZZY SET SYST, V111, P387, DOI 10.1016/S0165-0114(98)00041-4; Tian N, 2014, INT J MACH LEARN CYB, V5, P309, DOI 10.1007/s13042-013-0168-2; TVERSKY A, 1992, J RISK UNCERTAINTY, V5, P297, DOI 10.1007/BF00122574; Wang B, 2018, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V26, P3673, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2842752; Wang B, 2017, INFORM SCIENCES, V385, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2016.12.033; Wang B, 2011, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V19, P758, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2144599; Wang TX, 2020, INFORM SCIENCES, V519, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2020.01.030; Wang YM, 2006, EXPERT SYST APPL, V31, P309, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2005.09.040; Wu YN, 2019, ENERGY, V181, P1235, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.027; Yang B, 2020, INT J MACH LEARN CYB, V11, P973, DOI 10.1007/s13042-020-01082-x; Yao JT, 2015, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V23, P3, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2360548; Yao YY, 2010, INFORM SCIENCES, V180, P341, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2009.09.021; Yu H, 2019, INT J APPROX REASON, V115, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.ijar.2019.09.001; Zhang QH, 2021, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V212, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106526",44.0,82.0,7.0,76.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1868-8071,1868-808X,,INT J MACH LEARN CYB,Int.

We live in the era of the Third Industrial (or Digital) Revolution, but modern world leaders are already actively preparing for a new period-the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0. New forms of interaction open up opportunities in the organization of work and change requirements for employees. Business becomes digital, but the person stays. Employees will continue to remain crucial factors in innovation, continually developing products and services. The lack of talented and skilled personnel will be the main problem of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Flexible production through FIR will require much more skills in all workflows for all employees. Skilled workers will be more in demand in the future for making decisions that can not be replaced by any algorithm. At the same time, employees must be trained and qualified for new jobs, so it is essential to review standards, for example, in education and training, and adapt them to new requirements. The implementation of interactive technologies in learning has become a necessity. One of the effective methods is business games: both independently and in combination with theoretical training. Precisely this combination (practice) is optimal for students to learn lecture material and acquire competencies. The article is devoted to the description of the technique of conducting risk management training. We described the technology of the training, dividing it into two parts. In the first part, the students are reminded of the risk management theory; in the second part, a business game is held-""Investment portfolio"". In the article, we showed how it could be carried out with and without the use of gadgets/computers. As an example, we considered the most frequent mistake when conducting this game and gave a correct model. Besides, in the article, we gave formulas for automating the game of Excel. © BEIESP.",Probability; Profitability; Risk; Risk management,,,,Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication,22773878,,,,English,Int.

We propose to design both undirected and directed volatility networks of global stock market based on simple pair-wise correlation and system-wide connectedness of national stock indices using a vector auto-regressive model. We examine the effect and usefulness of network indicators by applying them as inputs for determining strategies via several machine learning approaches (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Two strategies are constructed considering stock price indices: (1) global stock market prediction strategy and (2) regional allocation strategy for developed market/emerging market. According to the results of the performance analysis, network indicators were proven to be important supplementary indicators in predicting global stock market and regional relative directions (up/down). In particular, these indicators were more effective during market crisis periods. This study is the first attempt to construct strategies for global portfolio management using financial network indicators and to suggest how network indicators can be used in practical fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Financial network; Global stock market; Investment strategy; Machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Decision trees; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Learning systems; Strategic planning; Financial networks; Global stock markets; Investment strategy; Logistic regressions; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Portfolio managements; Vector autoregressive model; Investments,"S.Y.

As DT projects are disruptive to an organisation and are significantly different from traditional information technology projects, it is important to understand the value that specific DT projects will bring to an organisation before they are implemented, so that DT project portfolios can be optimally managed. Aim: This study aims to determine the key goals and benefits of DT projects, as well as the selection criteria for DT projects in South African businesses. The study also explores the most influential technologies for driving the implementation of DT projects. Setting: South Africa is an emerging economy. The study was performed in the initial phases of nationwide lockdown owing to COVID-19. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 leaders from South African businesses of varying sizes, but all in significant local markets. Content analysis using CAQDAS was used to analyse the primary data, using both inductive and deductive coding methods. Results: South African businesses use a combination of financial and non-financial project selection criteria across four main goals and benefit categories: customer experience, operational efficiency, business culture, and traditional project evaluation. The fifth proposed goal (new business models) was not used to evaluate DT projects. The most influential technologies that drive the selection of DT projects were data-related, such as data storage, data processing, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. Conclusion: Companies in South Africa can use traditional project evaluation criteria together with several new criteria to determine the value of DT projects more holistically. This study also suggests several key practical takeaways for businesses that are aspiring to implement their own DT projects. © 2022. The Authors.

Due to its nature of learning from dynamic interactions and planning for long-run performance, reinforcement learning (RL) recently has received much attention in portfolio management. However, most of existing RL-based PM approaches in general only consider price changes of portfolio assets and the implicit correlations between price changes, while ignoring the rich relations between companies in the market, such as two assets in the same sector or two companies have a supplier-customer relation, which are very important for trading decision making. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose GPM, a novel graph convolutional network-based reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management, which first employs Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to extract asset relational features, and then combines relational features with multi-scale temporal features to make trading decisions for better performance. We also introduce softmax with temperature to increase portfolio diversity, which leads to further increase in profits. Experimental results on two real-world datasets: NASDAQ and NYSE, validate the effectiveness of GPM over state-of-the-art PM methods. Further, more experiments are conducted to evaluate GPM with different graph neural networks and different number of network layers, to explore proper settings for different markets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Company relationship; Graph convolutional network; Portfolio management; Reinforcement learning,Commerce; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Graph neural networks; Investments; Profitability; Public relations; Reinforcement learning; Sales; Company relationship; Convolutional networks; Decision-making process; Graph convolutional network; Management IS; Network-based; Portfolio managements; Price changes; Relational features; Risk levels; article; learning; profit; reinforcement (psychology); Convolution,"J.

A number of rules and barriers exist in the Chinese A-share market such as trading restrictions and high fees, as well as scarce and expensive hedging tools. It is difficult to achieve stable absolute returns in such a market. Stock correlation analysis and price prediction play an important role to achieve any profitable trading. The portfolio management and subsequent trading decisions highly depend on the results of stock correlation analysis and price prediction. However, it is nontrivial to analyze and predict any stocks, being time-varying and affected by unlimited factors in a given market. Traditional methods only take some certain factors into consideration but ignore others that may be changed dynamically. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model named Graph Attention Long Short-Term Memory (GALSTM) to learn the correlations between stocks and predict their future prices automatically. First, a multi-Hawkes Process is used to initial a correlation graph between stocks. This procedure provides a good training start as the multi-Hawkes Processes will be studied on the most saint feature fluctuations with any correlations being statistically significant. Then an attention-based LSTM is built to learn the weighting matrix underlying the dynamic graph. In addition, we also build matching data process plus portfolio management modules to form a complete system. The proposed GALSTM enables us to expand the scope of stock selection under the premise of controlling risks with limited hedging tools in the A-share market, thereby effectively increasing high-frequency excess returns. We then construct a long and short positions combination, select long positions in the A shares of the entire market, and use stock index futures to short. With GALSTM model, the products managed by our fully automatic quantitative trading system achieved an absolute annual return rate of 44.71% and the standard deviation of daily returns is only 0.42% in three months of operation. Only 1 week loss in 13 weeks of running time. © 2021",Graph attention long short-term memory (GALSTM); Hawkes processes; High-frequency trading; Portfolio management,Brain; Commerce; Correlation methods; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Graphic methods; Information management; Investments; Correlation analysis; Graph attention long short-term memory; Hawkes process; Hedging tools; High-frequency; High-frequency trading; Portfolio managements; Share market; Short term memory; Trading systems; Long short-term memory,"N.

However, shortcomings remain. Specifically, because the training environment of an RL-based portfolio optimization framework is usually constructed based on historical price data in the literature, the agent potentially 1) violates the definition of a Markov decision process (MDP), 2) ignores their own market impact, or 3) fails to account for causal relationships within interaction processes; these ultimately lead the agent to make poor generalizations. To surmount these problems - specifically, to help the RL-based portfolio agent make better generalizations - we introduce an interactive training environment that leverages a generative model, called the limit order book-generative adversarial model (LOB-GAN), to simulate a financial market. Specifically, the LOB-GAN models market ordering behavior, and LOB-GAN's generator is utilized as a market behavior simulator. A simulated financial market, called Virtual Market, is constructed by the market behavior simulator in conjunction with a realistic security matching system. Virtual Market is then leveraged as an interactive training environment for the RL-based portfolio agent. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves out-of-sample portfolio performance by 4%, which is superior to other generalization strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial market simulation; portfolio management; reinforcement learning,Commerce; Correlation theory; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Markov processes; Causal relationships; Generative model; Interaction process; Interactive training; Limit order book; Markov Decision Processes; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimization; Reinforcement learning,"S.-H.

The empirical study takes historical data of Hang Seng Index (HSI) and its constituents to analyze the effectiveness and practicability of the index tracking method. The results show that the index tracking method based on deep neural network has a smaller tracking error, and thus can effectively track the index. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use information consumption to proxy for investor learning during these announcements and construct ex ante measures of expected information consumption (EIC) to calibrate whether learning is priced. On days when there are information spillovers, affected stocks earn a significant return premium (5% annualized) and the capital asset pricing model performs better. The positive effect of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announcements on the risk premia of individual stocks appears to be modulated by EIC.

Despite striking volatility, their high average returns and low correlations have established CCs as alternative investment assets for portfolio and risk management. We investigate the benefits of adding CCs to well-diversified portfolios of conventional financial assets for different types of investors, including risk-averse, return-maximizing and diversification-seeking investors who may trade at different frequencies, namely, daily, weekly or monthly. We calculate out-of-sample performance and diversification benefits for the most popular portfolio-construction rules, including mean-variance optimization, risk-parity, and maximum-diversification strategies, as well as combined strategies. Our results demonstrate that CCs can improve the risk-return profile of portfolios, but their benefit depends on investor objectives. In particular, diversification strategies (maximizing the portfolio diversification index or equating risk contributions) draw appreciably on CCs and show, in line with spanning tests, CCs to be non-redundant extensions of the investment universe. However, when we introduce liquidity constraints via the LIBRO method to account for illiquidity of many CCs, out-of-sample performance drops considerably, while the diversification benefits persist. We conclude that the utility of CC investments strongly depends on investor characteristics.",Cryptocurrency; CRIX; Investments; Portfolio management; Asset classes; Blockchain; Bitcoin; Altcoins; DLT,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Petukhina, Alla; Trimborn, Simon; Hardle, Wolfgang Karl; Elendner, Hermann",,,,,English,,,,,,ART,"[Petukhina, Alla] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dorotheen Str 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Trimborn, Simon] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, 7-268 Lau Ming Wai Acad Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Humboldt Univ, IRTG 1792, Dorotheen Str 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Xiamen Univ Xiamen, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, N114,Econ Bldg, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Business, 50 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178899, Singapore; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Ke Karlovu 3, Prague 12116, Czech Republic; [Hardle, Wolfgang Karl] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat Management & Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Elendner, Hermann] Weizenbaum Inst, Hardenbergstr 32, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Elendner, Hermann] UCL Comp Sci, UCL Ctr Blockchain Technol, Malet Pl, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Elendner, Hermann] ABC Res, Austrian Blockchain Ctr, Favoritenstr 111, A-1100 Vienna, Austria",Humboldt University of Berlin; City University of Hong Kong; Humboldt University of Berlin; Singapore Management University; Charles University Prague; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; University of London; University College London,"Trimborn, S (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, 7-268 Lau Ming Wai Acad Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",trimborn.econometrics@gmail.com,"Petukhina, Alla/KCJ-6728-2024; Härdle, Wolfgang/C-5963-2013; Trimborn, Simon/HNI-4123-2023","Trimborn, Simon/0000-0003-3745-4164; Petukhina, Alla/0000-0001-5818-789X","Czech Science Foundation (Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky) [19/28231X]; NUS FRC grant [R-146-000-298-114]; CityU Start-up Grant [7200680]; European Union's Horizon 2020 'FIN-TECH' Project [825215]; IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,' Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin","Czech Science Foundation (Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky); NUS FRC grant; CityU Start-up Grant; European Union's Horizon 2020 'FIN-TECH' Project; IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,' Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin","Financial support from IRTG 1792 'High Dimensional Non Stationary Time Series,' Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Czech Science Foundation (Grantova Agentura C. eske Republiky) under grant no. 19/28231X and NUS FRC grant R-146-000-298-114 'Augmented machine learning and network analysis with applications to cryptocurrencies and blockchains' as well as CityU Start-up Grant 7200680 `Textual Analysis in Digital Markets' is gratefully acknowledged.

Thus, in this study, we examine the impacts that predictive power investor sentiment has over the price of China's crude oil. We first constructed investor sentiment indexes of China's crude oil futures based on specific economic variables and comments found on one of the most active online financial forums. Then, five popular machine learning tools were utilized to generate predictions. According to our findings, the long short-term memory model combined with the composite sentiment index performed the best due to a lower rate of prediction errors and greater directional accuracy for time-series forecasting of one-day-ahead prices.

While these techniques, such as Deep Belief Networks or Random Forests, are becoming more and more popular on the market, the academic literature is relatively sparse. Through a series of applications involving hundreds of variables/predictors and stocks, this article presents some of the state-of-the-art techniques and how they can be implemented to manage a long-short portfolio. Numerous practical and empirical issues are developed. One of the main questions beyond big data use is the value of information. Does an increase in the number of predictors improve the portfolio performance? Which features are the most important? A large number of predictors means, potentially, a high level of noise. How do the algorithms manage this? This article develops an application using a 22-year trading period, up to 300 U.S. large caps and around 600 predictors. The empirical results underline the ability of these techniques to generate useful trading signals for portfolios with important turnovers and short holding periods (one or five days). Positive excess returns are reported between 1993 and 2008. They are strongly reduced after accounting for transaction costs and traditional risk factors. When these machine learning tools were readily available in the market, excess returns turned into the negative in most recent times. Results also show that adding features is far from being a guarantee to boost the alpha of the portfolio. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Finance; Machine learning; Statistical arbitrage,Big data; Commerce; Decision trees; Deep learning; Finance; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Metadata; Academic literature; Deep belief networks; Long-short portfolio; Portfolio managements; State-of-the-art techniques; Statistical arbitrage; Transaction cost; Value of information; Machine learning,,,Elsevier B.V.,03772217,,EJORD,,English,Eur J Oper Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064846164,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0.7010834813117981,

The trained autoencoder generates a set of latent representations that constitutes a combined -‘communal’- factor to better explains a large portion of the return differences among the stocks in an index. After analyzing all the stocks in S&P-500, Russel-3000, and NASDAQ-100, we found that our proposed latent factor model outperforms many other factor models in predicting the next day's return. Notably, the experiment results show that on average non-communal stocks earn 0.05% over communal stocks. However, the risk associated with this non-communal stock is also 0.8% higher than communal stocks. The experiments confirm that the superior performance comes from the compensation of high risk associated with these non-communal stocks. Investors will benefit from our latent factor model to identify these communal and non-communal stocks for a high return while diversifying their asset portfolio. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Asset pricing; Autoencoders; Fintech; Machine learning; Nonlinear factor model,,"A.

Using patent and R&D data, I show that firms with more technology spillover earn 7.7% higher annualized returns than firms with less technology spillover. Exploiting three quasi-natural experiments, I find that the return effect is strengthened (attenuated) when there is a plausibly exogenous increase (decrease) in the flow of technological information across firms. I also find that firms with more technology spillover have higher cash flow sensitivity to aggregate consumption, numbers of new products, and stock return synchronicity. These findings are consistent with models on learning about new technology; specifically, spillover enables learning about new technology to facilitate timely and large-scale adoption of new technology, which in turn exposes spillover recipients to additional systematic risk. These findings highlight the influence of innovation externality on stock returns. © 2022 The Author(s)",Disclosure; Externality; Information flow; Natural experiments; Stock returns; Technology spillover,,"K.

When the model is misspecified or misestimated, however, it often leads to unrealistically rapid switching dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel estimation approach based on clustering temporal features while penalizing jumps. We compare the approach to spectral clustering and the standard approach of maximizing the likelihood function in an extensive simulation study and an application to financial data. The advantages of the proposed jump estimator include that it learns the hidden state sequence and model parameters simultaneously and faster while providing control over the transition rate, it is less sensitive to initialization, it performs better when the number of states increases, and it is robust to misspecified conditional distributions. The value of estimating the true persistence of the state process is illustrated through a simple trading strategy where improved estimates result in much lower transaction costs. Robustness is particularly critical when the model is part of a system used in production. Therefore, our proposed estimator significantly improves the potential for using hidden Markov models in practical applications. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The PDEs in such applications are high-dimensional as the dimension corresponds to the number of financial assets in a portfolio. Moreover, such PDEs are often fully nonlinear due to the need to incorporate certain nonlinear phenomena in the model such as default risks, transaction costs, volatility uncertainty (Knightian uncertainty), or trading constraints in the model. Such high-dimensional fully nonlinear PDEs are exceedingly difficult to solve as the computational effort for standard approximation methods grows exponentially with the dimension. In this work, we propose a new method for solving high-dimensional fully nonlinear second-order PDEs. Our method can in particular be used to sample from high-dimensional nonlinear expectations. The method is based on (1) a connection between fully nonlinear second-order PDEs and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), (2) a merged formulation of the PDE and the 2BSDE problem, (3) a temporal forward discretization of the 2BSDE and a spatial approximation via deep neural nets, and (4) a stochastic gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical results obtained using TensorFlow in Python illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the method in the cases of a 100-dimensional Black–Scholes–Barenblatt equation, a 100-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, and a nonlinear expectation of a 100-dimensional G-Brownian motion. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2BSDE; Black–Scholes–Barenblatt equation; Deep learning; G-Brownian motion; Hamiltonian–Jacobi–Bellman equation; HJB equation; Knightian uncertainty; Nonlinear expectation; Numerical method; Second-order backward stochastic differential equation,Approximation algorithms; Brownian movement; Costs; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Dynamic programming; Electronic trading; Numerical methods; Partial differential equations; Stochastic systems; 2BSDE; Backward stochastic differential equations; Bellman equations; G-Brownian motion; HJB equations; Knightian uncertainty; Nonlinear expectation; Nonlinear equations,"C.

The algorithmic trading strategy is developed from the perspective of a proprietary trading firm to maximize profit. A recurrent neural network-based Locational Marginal Price (LMP) spread forecast model is developed by leveraging the inter-hour dependencies of the market clearing algorithm. The LMP spread sensitivity with respect to net virtual bids is modeled as a monotonic function with the proposed constrained gradient boosting tree. We leverage the proposed algorithmic virtual bid trading strategy to evaluate both the profitability of the virtual bid portfolio and the efficiency of U.S. wholesale electricity markets. The comprehensive empirical analysis on PJM, ISO-NE, and CAISO indicates that the proposed virtual bid portfolio optimization strategy considering the price sensitivity explicitly outperforms the one that neglects the price sensitivity. The Sharpe ratio of virtual bid portfolios for all three electricity markets are much higher than that of the S&P 500 index. It was also shown that the efficiency of CAISO's two-settlement system is lower than that of PJM and ISO-NE.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity markets; machine learning; market efficiency; virtual bidding,E-learning; Efficiency; Learning systems; Power markets; Profitability; Recurrent neural networks; Turing machines; Algorithmic trading; Empirical analysis; Locational marginal prices; Monotonic functions; Portfolio optimization; Settlement systems; Trading strategies; Wholesale electricity markets; Electronic trading,"N.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly its subfield of machine learning (ML) methods have gained immense popularity among the great public and achieved tremendous success in many real-life applications by leading to vast efficiency gains. In the financial trading domain, ML can augment human capabilities in price prediction, dynamic portfolio optimization, and other financial decision-making tasks. However, thanks to constant progress in the ML technology, the prospect of increasingly capable and autonomous agents to delegate operational tasks and even decision-making is now beyond mere imagination, thus opening up the possibility for approximating (truly) autonomous trading agents anytime soon. Given these spectacular developments, this Article argues that such autonomous algorithmic traders may involve significant risks to market integrity, independent from their human experts, thanks to self-learning capabilities offered by state-of-the-art and innovative ML methods. Using the proprietary trading industry as a case study, we explore emerging threats to the application of established market abuse laws in the event of algorithmic market abuse, by taking an interdisciplinary stance between financial regulation, law and economics, and computational finance. Specifically, our analysis focuses on two emerging market abuse risks by autonomous algorithms: market manipulation and “tacit” collusion. We explore their likelihood to arise in global capital markets and evaluate related social harm as forms of market failures. With these new risks in mind, this Article questions the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms, as well as current legal rules on the governance of algorithmic trading, to cope with increasingly autonomous and ubiquitous algorithmic trading systems. We demonstrate how the “black box” nature of specific ML-powered algorithmic trading strategies can subvert existing market abuse laws, which are based upon traditional liability concepts and tests (such as “intent” and “causation”). We conclude by addressing the shortcomings of the present legal framework and develop a number of guiding principles to assist legal and policy reform in the spirit of promoting and safeguarding market integrity and safety. © 2021 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

The data is the daily price of CBOT soybean futures from 3 January 2000 to 20 December 2019, with a total of 5025 trading days. The empirical results also show that the perspective based on MF-DFA can explain the market's nonlinear, long-range correlation, predictability and other financial anomalies. At the same time, the prediction of price change direction and risk degree of the market are further studied. It is pointed out that multifractal characteristics are generated under the joint action of fat-tail distribution and long-range correlation. Investors can make use of these market characteristics to make arbitrage possible. Finally, based on the empirical results, some policy suggestions are put forward: strengthening rational investment education, strengthening supervision, reducing information asymmetry and other measures to improve market efficiency.",inefficiency; nonlinearity; soybean; MF-DFA; futures,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,WoS,J,,,,"Yin, Tao; Wang, Yiming",,,,,English,,,,,,,"[Yin, Tao; Wang, Yiming] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Wang, YM (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",1701110936@pku.edu.cn; wangyiming@pku.edu.cn,,"Yin, Tao/0000-0001-6971-7374","National Social Science Fund youth project ""research on nonlinear asset pricing model based on deep learning theory under the background of big data Project"" [18CJY057]","National Social Science Fund youth project ""research on nonlinear asset pricing model based on deep learning theory under the background of big data Project""","This research is funded by the National Social Science Fund youth project ""research on nonlinear asset pricing model based on deep learning theory under the background of big data Project"" (fund number 18CJY057).","Al-Yahyaee KH, 2018, FINANC RES LETT, V27, P228, DOI 10.1016/j.frl.2018.03.017; Alvarez-Ramirez J, 2008, ENERG ECON, V30, P2645, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2008.05.006; [Anonymous], 1976, FDN OFFINANCE PORTFO; BARABASI AL, 1991, PHYS REV A, V44, P2730, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevA.44.2730; Bouoiyour J, 2018, FINANC RES LETT, V26, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.frl.2017.12.008; Cao GX, 2013, PHYSICA A, V392, P797, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2012.10.042; Chatrath A, 2002, AGR ECON, V27, P123, DOI 10.1111/j.1574-0862.2002.tb00111.x; Corazza M, 1997, J FUTURES MARKETS, V17, P433, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9934(199706)17:4<433::AID-FUT4>3.0.CO;2-I; Edgar P., 1991, CHAOS ORDER CAPITAL, P1; El Alaoui M, 2019, FINANC RES LETT, V31, P374, DOI 10.1016/j.frl.2018.12.011; Engelen S, 2011, ENERG ECON, V33, P88, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2010.05.009; Ftiti Z, 2019, APPL ECON, V51, P3122, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2018.1564122; Giannellis N, 2009, ECON MODEL, V26, P155, DOI 10.1016/j.econmod.2008.06.013; Gopikrishnan P, 2001, PHYSICA A, V299, P137, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4371(01)00288-6; Ihlen EAF, 2012, FRONT PHYSIOL, V3, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2012.00141; Immonen E, 2017, J MATH ECON, V69, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.jmateco.2016.12.005; Kantelhardt JW, 2002, PHYSICA A, V316, P87, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4371(02)01383-3; Lak F, 2017, COMMUN STAT-SIMUL C, V46, P4841, DOI 10.1080/03610918.2015.1134570; Lashermes B, 2004, Int.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to portfolio formation strategy based on a hybrid machine learning model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with robust input features obtained from Huber’s location for stock prediction and the Markowitz mean-variance (MV) model for optimal portfolio construction. Specifically, this study first applies a prediction method for stock preselection to ensure high-quality stock inputs for portfolio formation. Then, the predicted results are integrated into the MV model. To comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, we used two portfolio models, the MV model and the equal-weight portfolio (1/N) model, with LSTM, BiLSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM, and employed them as benchmarks. Between January 2015 and December 2020, historical data from the Stock Exchange of Thailand 50 Index (SET50) were collected for the study. The experiment shows that integrating preselection of stocks can improve MV performance, and the results of the proposed method show that they outperform comparison models in terms of Sharpe ratio, mean return, and risk. © 2022 by the authors.",machine learning; mean-variance model; portfolio optimization; stock prediction; stock selection,,"R.

Recent developments in machine learning have brought significant opportunities to incorporate prediction theory into portfolio selection. However, many studies show that a single prediction model is insufficient to achieve very accurate predictions and affluent returns. In this paper, a novel portfolio construction approach is developed using a hybrid model based on machine learning for stock prediction and mean–variance (MV) model for portfolio selection. Specifically, two stages are involved in this model: stock prediction and portfolio selection. In the first stage, a hybrid model combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with an improved firefly algorithm (IFA) is proposed to predict stock prices for the next period. The IFA is developed to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost. In the second stage, stocks with higher potential returns are selected, and the MV model is employed for portfolio selection. Using the Shanghai Stock Exchange as the study sample, the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to traditional ways (without stock prediction) and benchmarks in terms of returns and risks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",eXtreme Gradient Boosting; Firefly algorithm; Mean–variance model; Portfolio selection; Stock prediction,Financial data processing; Financial markets; Forecasting; Machine learning; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Accurate prediction; Construction approaches; Firefly algorithms; Future performance; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection; Shanghai stock exchanges; Stock price prediction; Fintech,"W.

This study presents a new MV model constructed using stationary portfolios composed of cointegrated stocks. The expected return of this new model is predicted by using machine learning models, such as support vector machine, random forest, and attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The proposed model is evaluated using data on stocks in the CSI 300 and the S&P 500, with 42 features over 8 years from May 4, 2012 to August 4, 2020. The empirical results show that the portfolio constructed based on the stationary portfolios in both the Chinese and the US stock markets delivers significant profits. Further, the attention-based LSTM network can more accurately model the spread return using technical indicators, financial investment information, and lagged returns, and can successfully select pairs of cointegrated stocks for constructing a more profitable MV portfolio, than can conventional machine learning models. Using the attention-based LSTM to predict 20-day return movement results in model accuracy of up to 92.59% for the CSI 300 and 88.52% for the S&P 500, and a corresponding Sharpe ratio of 9.31 and 2.77, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Attention-based LSTM network; Mean-reverting spread prediction; Mean–variance portfolio optimization; Pairs trading; Stationary portfolio,Commerce; Decision trees; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Long short-term memory; Profitability; Support vector machines; Attention-based long short-term memory network; Machine learning models; Mean variance model; Mean-reverting spread prediction; Mean-variance portfolio optimization; Memory network; Modeling construct; Nonstationary; Pairs trading; Stationary portfolio; Forecasting,,,Elsevier Ltd,09574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128329625,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0.9981645941734314,

However, existing RL-based approaches rarely focus on scalability or reusability to adapt to the ever-changing markets. These approaches are rigid and unscalable to accommodate the varying number of assets of portfolios and increasing need for heterogeneous data input. Also, RL agents in the existing systems are ad-hoc trained and hardly reusable for different portfolios. To confront the above problems, a modular design is desired for the systems to be compatible with reusable asset-dedicated agents. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent RL-based system for PM (MSPM). MSPM involves two types of asynchronously-updated modules: Evolving Agent Module (EAM) and Strategic Agent Module (SAM). An EAM is an information-generating module with a Deep Q-network (DQN) agent, and it receives heterogeneous data and generates signal-comprised information for a particular asset. An SAM is a decision-making module with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent for portfolio optimization, and it connects to multiple EAMs to reallocate the corresponding assets in a financial portfolio. Once been trained, EAMs can be connected to any SAM at will, like assembling LEGO blocks. With its modularized architecture, the multi-step condensation of volatile market information, and the reusable design of EAM, MSPM simultaneously addresses the two challenges in RL-based PM: scalability and reusability. Experiments on 8-year U.S. stock market data prove the effectiveness of MSPM in profit accumulation by its outperformance over five different baselines in terms of accumulated rate of return (ARR), daily rate of return (DRR), and Sortino ratio (SR). MSPM improves ARR by at least 186.5% compared to constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP), a widely-used PM strategy. To validate the indispensability of EAM, we back-test and compare MSPMs on four different portfolios. EAM-enabled MSPMs improve ARR by at least 1341.8% compared to EAM-disabled MSPMs. © 2022 Huang, Tanaka.

Consequently, an effective computational method for evaluating potential risk factors and returns is crucial for the development of algorithmic trading strategies. In traditional finance and financial engineering research, statistical approaches have been widely applied to quantitative analysis. Meanwhile, investor demand for quantitative hedge funds has surged worldwide. In the current study, the multiperiod portfolio selection problem was considered in terms of the realistic transaction cost model, which is a major concern for quantitative hedge fund managers. We developed a dedicated multiagent-based deep reinforcement learning framework with a two-level nested agent structure to determine effective portfolio management methods with different objectives. In addition, we proposed a specially-designed reward function for investment performance evaluation and a novel policy network structure for trading decision-making. To efficiently identify specific asset attributes in a portfolio, each agent is equipped with a refined deep policy network and a special training method that enables the proposed reinforcement learning agent to learn risk transfer behaviors. The results revealed the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperformed several established or representative portfolio selection strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Deep reinforcement learning; Multiagent; Portfolio selection,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Multi agent systems; Personnel training; Reinforcement learning; Wooden fences; Algorithmic approach; Hedge Funds; Investment firms; Multi agent; Policy networks; Portfolio managements; Portfolio selection; Potential risks; Risk factors; Risk shifting; Deep learning,"S.-H.

Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown its promising capabilities in sequential decision making problems. However, traditional DRL algorithms directly operate in the space of low-level actions, which exhibits poor scalability and becomes intractable in real-world problem instances when the dimensionality of the environment increases. To deal with this, in this work, a novel DRL hyper-heuristic framework is proposed for multi-period portfolio optimization problem. Instead of exploiting the entire action domain, our proposed approach is more effective by searching for low-level well-developed trading strategies. In addition, our proposed approach is data-driven and respects the nature of the problem by taking advantage of expert domain knowledge and posing it multidimensional states to further leverage additional diverse information from alternative views of the environment. The proposed approach is evaluated on five real-world capital market problem instances and numerous experimental results demonstrate our proposed method can achieve notable performance gains compared to state-of-art trading strategies as well as traditional DRL baseline method. The data we used are from five stock indices, covering the period from the 2012 to 2022. Our study can have salient policy implications for investment strategy formulation and effective regulatory frameworks establishment. © 2023 The Author(s)",Decision making; Deep reinforcement learning; Hyper-heuristic; Portfolio optimization; Uncertainty,Commerce; Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Heuristic methods; Investments; Knowledge management; Optimization; Public policy; Reinforcement learning; Decisions makings; Deep reinforcement learning; Heuristics approaches; Hyper-heuristics; Multi-period; Portfolio optimization; Problem instances; Reinforcement learnings; Trading strategies; Uncertainty; decision making; heuristics; investment; machine learning; optimization; uncertainty analysis; Decision making,"T.

Inter-organizational multi-project management takes place between project-based firms and other actors in project networks. The multi-project aspects in inter-organizational contexts cause significant management complexity, but their specific requirements are inadequately understood. This article explores the nature and requirements of project-based firms' multi-project management in inter-organizational contexts. Parallel and sequential inter-organizational multi-project settings are proposed as an expansion to the dominant intra-organizational research. A thematic framework is developed based on stakeholder and agency theories and previous knowledge from portfolio and program management research complemented with an inductive analysis of extant literature. Consequently, we map and report previous research on multi-project management requirements relevant to inter-organizational contexts concerning strategy, resources, governance, and learning.

In particular, tracking textual changes among companies’ reports can have a large and significant impact on stock prices. This impact happens with a lag implying that investors only gradually realize the implications of the news hinted by document changes. However, the length of these documents as well as their complexity in terms of structure and language have been increasing dramatically making this process more and more difficult to perform. In this paper, we analyzed how to face this complexity by learning arbitrary dimensional vector representations for US corporate filings (10-Ks) from 1998 to 2018, exploiting and comparing different neural network embedding techniques which take into account words’ semantics through vectors proximity. We also compared their ability to capture changes associated with future risk-adjusted abnormal returns with other more commonly used approaches in literature. Finally, we propose a novel investment strategy named Semantic Similarity Portfolio (SSP) that exploits these neural network embeddings. We show that firms that do not change their 10-Ks in a semantically important way from the previous year tend to have large and statistically significant future risk-adjusted abnormal returns. We, also document an amplifying effect when we incorporate a momentum-related criterion, where the companies selected must also have had positive previous year returns. Specifically, a portfolio that buys “non-changers” based on this strategy earns up to 10% in yearly risk-adjusted abnormal returns (alpha). © 2020",Annual reports; Asset pricing; Document embedding; Inattention; Machine learning; Neural network embedding,Complex networks; Electronic trading; Embeddings; Financial markets; Semantics; Abnormal returns; Amplifying effect; Dimensional vectors; Financial reports; Investment strategy; Network embedding; Portfolio selection; Semantic similarity; Neural networks,"G.

With advances in artificial intelligence, many studies have indicated that deep reinforcement learning (RL) can perform well in quantitative trading by predicting price change trends in the financial market. However, most of the related frameworks display poor generalizability in the testing stage. Thus, we incorporated adversarial learning and a novel sampling strategy for RL portfolio management. The goal was to construct a portfolio comprising five assets from the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and to achieve excellent performance through our trading strategy. We used adversarial learning during the RL process to enhance the model's robustness. Moreover, to improve the model's computational efficiency, we introduced a novel sampling strategy to determine which data are worth learning by observing the learning condition. The experimental results revealed that the model with our sampling strategy had more favorable performance than the random learning strategy. The Sharpe ratio increased by 6 %-7 %, and profit increased by nearly 45 %. Thus, our proposed learning framework and the sampling strategy we employed are conducive to obtaining reliable trading rules.  © 2013 IEEE.",adversarial learning; Portfolio management; reinforcement learning,Commerce; Computational efficiency; Deep learning; Financial markets; Investments; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Sampling; Adaptive sampling strategies; Adversarial learning; Dow Jones Industrial averages; Learning frameworks; Mathematical approach; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimization; Reinforcement algorithms; Electronic trading,"S.-H.

A large body of literature to-date suggests Support Vector Machines (SVM)as the “best of regression” algorithms for financial data regression. Recent work however found that new deep learning––Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs)outperformed SVM for classification problems. In the present paper we conduct a new unbiased evaluation of these two modelling techniques for regression problems, and we also compare them with a popular regression model - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)model for financial volatility or risk forecasting. Our experiments using financial data show that the LSTM RNNs performed as good as v-SVR for large interval volatility forecasting and both performed much better than GARCH model for two financial indices (S&P 500 and AAPL). The LSTM RNNS deep learning method can learn from big raw data and can be run with many hidden layers and neurons under GPU to achieve a good prediction for long sequence data compared to the support vector regression. The deep learning technique - LSTM RNNs with big data can be used to improve the volatility prediction instead of v-SVR when the v-SVR does not predict well for some financial stocks of a portfolio. This will help investors to win the competition to maximize their profit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)model; Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks; Support Vector Machines (SVM); Volatility forecasting,Brain; Deep learning; Financial markets; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Learning techniques; Modelling techniques; Portfolio optimisation; Prediction accuracy; Regression problem; Support vector regression (SVR); Volatility forecasting; Long short-term memory,,,Elsevier Ltd,09574174,,ESAPE,,English,Expert Sys Appl,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065212010,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0.9655755758285522,

Sometimes, it is not easy to track and measure accurately some state variables, and it may be more effective to make decisions based on imprecise information. This paper is focused on the design of an observer (which is unknown) for a class of ergodic homogeneous finite Markov chains with partially observable states. The main goal of the proposed method is the derivation of formulas for computing an observer, and as a result, on optimal control policy. For solving the problem, we introduce a new variable, which involves the product of the policy, the observation kernel and the distribution vector. We derive the formulas to recover the variables of interest. This work considers a dynamic environment for learning the parameters of the POMDP model. The construction of the adaptive policies is based on an identification approach, where we estimate the elements of the transition matrices and utility matrices by counting the number of unobserved experiences. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the practical implications of the theoretical issues applied to a portfolio optimization problem. These findings are important and new to the literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Markov chains; Observer design; Optimal control; Partially observed,Financial data processing; Matrix algebra; Reinforcement learning; Identification approach; Incomplete information; Observer design; Optimal control policy; Optimal controls; Partially observable Markov decision process; Partially observed; Portfolio optimization; Markov processes,"J.B.

However, there is no consensus in the literature on which specification arising from the volatility equation and the assumed error distribution is better in an out-of-sample performance. This study tries to fill this gap by comparing the forecasting performances of 110 GARCH-type models for Bitcoin volatility. Furthermore, it proposes a new combining method based on support vector machines (SVM). This method effectively selects the set of superior models to perform meta-learning.

By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we can greatly speed up the solution time. Our approach encodes the optimal solution into a small amount of information denoted as strategy using the voice of optimization framework. In this way, the core part of the optimization routine becomes a multiclass classification problem that can be solved very quickly. In this work, we extend that framework to real-time and high-speed applications focusing on parametric mixed-integer quadratic optimization. We propose an extremely fast online optimization method consisting of a feedforward neural network evaluation and a linear system solution where the matrix has already been factorized. Therefore, this online approach does not require any solver or iterative algorithm. We show the speed of the proposed method both in terms of total computations required and measured execution time. We estimate the number of floating point operations required to completely recover the optimal solution as a function of the problem dimensions. Compared with state-of-the-art MIO routines, the online running time of our method is very predictable and can be lower than a single matrix factorization time. We benchmark our method against the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi obtaining up to two to three orders of magnitude speedups on examples from fuel cell energy management, sparse portfolio optimization, and motion planning with obstacle avoidance. © 2022 INFORMS.",analysis of algorithms: computational complexity; artificial intelligence; computational methods; heuristic; mixed-integer optimization,Computational complexity; Factorization; Feedforward neural networks; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Linear systems; Matrix algebra; Optimal systems; Analyse of algorithm: computational complexity; Analysis of algorithms; Heuristic; High Speed; Mixed integer optimization; Online optimization; Optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Optimization routine; State of the art; Quadratic programming,"B.

The ability of Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and interactions makes it possible to apply it in the field of portfolio management (PM). However, the built-in quadratic complexity of the Transformer prevents its direct application to the PM task. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based PM framework called LSRE-CAAN, with two important components: a long sequence representations extractor and a cross-asset attention network. Direct Policy Gradient is used to solve the sequential decision problem in the PM process. We conduct numerical experiments in three aspects using four different cryptocurrency datasets, and the empirical results show that our framework is more effective than both traditional and state-of-the-art (SOTA) online portfolio strategies, achieving a 6x return on the best dataset. In terms of risk metrics, our framework has an average volatility risk of 0.46 and an average maximum drawdown risk of 0.27 across the four datasets, both of which are lower than the vast majority of SOTA strategies. In addition, while the vast majority of SOTA strategies maintain a poor turnover rate of approximately greater than 50% on average, our framework enjoys a relatively low turnover rate on all datasets, efficiency analysis illustrates that our framework no longer has the quadratic dependency limitation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Deep reinforcement learning; High-frequency trading; Online learning; Portfolio management,Bitcoin; Deep learning; E-learning; Financial data processing; Investments; Deep reinforcement learning; High frequency data; High-frequency trading; Online learning; Online portfolios; Portfolio managements; Reinforcement learnings; Sequence models; State of the art; Turnover rate; Reinforcement learning,"Y.

We present an autoregressive exogenous model and three nonlinear frameworks with different patterns of asymmetry. Based on daily data from January 7, 1997, to December 29, 2017, our analysis reaches two main findings. First, the nonlinear frameworks outperform the linear model (i.e., the autoregressive exogenous model) in modeling the relationship between oil and gas prices. Second, the nature of asymmetry varies based on market direction. We show that when oil prices exhibit an extreme movement (i.e., beyond a threshold value in absolute value), gas prices react nonlinearly, and that there is no relationship otherwise. Our results are robust for other frequencies, mainly weekly and monthly. These findings explain the conflicting results in the literature on the complex relationship between these markets. The results might serve investors in term of hedging, portfolio diversification, and asset allocation as we show that in the calm period, there is no relationship between oil and gas prices; however, the interaction between markets is more pronounced during periods of extreme movement. Similarly, policymakers’ awareness of the nonlinear dynamic under extreme movements could inform the regulation policy and/or adjustment in case oil (gas) prices increase or decrease. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Causality; Gas; Machine learning; Nonlinear modeling; Oil; Optimization,,"Z.

(Deep hedging. Quant. Finance, 2019, 19(8), 1271–1291). The market frictions are transaction costs, liquidity constraints, trading limits and cost of funds. The loss function is a spectral risk measure. We first make an empirical analysis of the LSTM-RNN model of real option markets, which are the Asian market (domestic market 50 ETF option, Hong Kong Hang Seng Index Option, Nikkei Index Option), the North American market (S&P 500 Index Option) and the European market (FTSE 100 Index Option). The benchmark models are from Leland (Option pricing and replication with transaction costs. J. Finance., 1985, 40(5), 1283–1301), Boyle and Vorst (Option replication in discrete time with transaction costs. J. Finance, 1992, 47(1), 271–293) and Whalley and Wilmott (A hedging strategy and option valuation model with transaction costs. OCIAM Working Paper, Mathematical Institute, Oxford, 1993). Finally, we compare the results from the LSTM-RNN model with benchmark models involving transaction costs for both simulated market data generated by Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and the Heston model and real market data. The results show that the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models for low or medium volatility (<0.8), OTM moneyness and under a certain risk level (<80%) in the GBM market setting. For the 50ETF option market, the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models for ATM and under a certain risk level (<15%). For the HSI option market, the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models when transaction costs are smaller than 1.5%. For the Nikkei and S&P 500 option markets, the LSTM-RNN model always outperforms benchmark models. For the FTSE option market, the LSTM-RNN model outperforms benchmark models when moneyness is not too deeply ITM. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Deep learning; Option hedging; Portfolio optimization; Risk management,,"J.

The nonlinear machine learning models generate statistically and economically sizable profits in the long-short portfolios of equity options even after accounting for transaction costs. Although option-based characteristics are the most important standalone predictors, stock-based measures offer substantial incremental predictive power when considered alongside option-based characteristics. Finally, we provide compelling evidence that option return predictability is driven by informational frictions and option mispricing.

This paper proposes a mixed method consisting of long short-term memory networks and mean-variance model for optimal portfolio formation in conjunction with the asset preselection, in which long-term dependences of financial time-series data can be captured. The experiment uses a large volume of sample data from the UK Stock Exchange 100 Index between March 1994 and March 2019. In the first stage, long short-term memory networks are used to forecast the return of assets and select assets with higher potential returns. After comparing the outcomes of the long short-term memory networks against support vector machine, random forest, deep neural networks, and autoregressive integrated moving average model, we discover that long short-term memory networks are appropriate for financial time-series forecasting, to beat the other benchmark models by a very clear margin. In the second stage, based on selected assets with higher returns, the mean-variance model is applied for portfolio optimisation. The validation of this methodology is carried out by comparing the proposed model with the other five baseline strategies, to which the proposed model clearly outperforms others in terms of the cumulative return per year, Sharpe ratio per triennium as well as average return to the risk per month of each triennium. i.e. potential returns and risks. © 2019",Asset preselection; Financial forecasting; Long-term financial data; Portfolio optimisation,Brain; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Investments; Long short-term memory; Support vector machines; Time series; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Financial data; Financial forecasting; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Portfolio managements; Portfolio optimisation; Pre-selection; Financial data processing,"K.

Traditional and generic portfolio strategies require forecasting of future stock prices as model inputs, which is not a trivial task since those values are difficult to obtain in the real-world applications. To overcome the above limitations and provide a better solution for portfolio management, we developed a Portfolio Management System (PMS) using reinforcement learning with two neural networks (CNN and RNN). A novel reward function involving Sharpe ratios is also proposed to evaluate the performance of the developed systems. Experimental results indicate that the PMS with the Sharpe ratio reward function exhibits outstanding performance, increasing return by 39.0% and decreasing drawdown by 13.7% on average compared to the reward function of trading return. In addition, the proposed PMS_CNN model is more suitable for the construction of a reinforcement learning portfolio, but has 1.98 times more drawdown risk than the PMS_RNN. Among the conducted datasets, the PMS outperforms the benchmark strategies in TW50 and traditional stocks, but is inferior to a benchmark strategy in the financial dataset. The PMS is profitable, effective, and offers lower investment risk among almost all datasets. The novel reward function involving the Sharpe ratio enhances performance, and well supports resource-allocation for empirical stock trading. © 2021, The Author(s).",Convolutional and recurrent neural network; Equity market neutral; Portfolio management; Reinforcement learning,Commerce; Electronic trading; Investments; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Equity markets; Investment risks; Model inputs; Portfolio managements; Portfolio strategies; Reward function; Sharpe ratios; Stock trading; Financial markets,"J.C.-W.

Prediction outcomes also are the prerequisites for active portfolio construction and optimization. However, the stock prediction is a challenging task because of the diversified factors involved such as uncertainty and instability. Most of the previous research focuses on analyzing financial historical data based on statistical techniques, which is known as a type of time series analysis with limited achievements. Recently, deep learning techniques, specifically recurrent neural network (RNN), has been designed to work with sequence prediction. In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is a special kind of RNN, is proposed to predict stock movement based on historical data. In order to construct an efficient portfolio, multiple portfolio optimization techniques, including equal-weighted modeling (EQ), simulation modeling Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and optimization modeling mean variant optimization (MVO), are used to improve the portfolio performance. The results showed that our proposed LSTM prediction model works efficiently by obtaining high accuracy from stock prediction. The constructed portfolios based on the LSTM prediction model outperformed other constructed portfolios-based prediction models such as linear regression and support vector machine. In addition, optimization techniques showed a significant improvement in the return and Sharpe ratio of the constructed portfolios. Furthermore, our constructed portfolios beat the benchmark Standard and Poor 500 (S&P 500) index in both active returns and Sharpe ratios. © 2020 by the authors.",LSTM; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative trading; Stock prediction,,"C.-M.

To understand the motivation of those communities, this work improves two existing open source models with a Pareto Optimization and two objectives: costs and carbon emissions. Clustering algorithms support the improvement of the models' scalability and performance. The methods developed in this work gives stakeholders the tool to calculate the capabilities and restrictions of the local energy system. The models are applied to a case study using data from an Austrian city, Linz. Four scenarios help to understand aspects of the energy community, such as the lock-in effect of existing infrastructure and future developments. The results show that it is possible to reduce both objectives, but the solutions for minimum costs and minimum carbon emissions are contrary to each other. This work quantifies the highest effect of emission reduction by the electrification of the system.

Since machine learning and deep learning models have shown overwhelming superiority than time series models, this paper combines return prediction in portfolio formation with two machine learning models, i.e., random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), and three deep learning models, i.e., LSTM neural network, deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP) and convolutional neural network. To be specific, this paper first applies these prediction models for stock preselection before portfolio formation. Then, this paper incorporates their predictive results in advancing mean–variance (MV) and omega portfolio optimization models. In order to present the superiority of these models, portfolio models with autoregressive integrated moving average's return prediction are used as benchmarks. Evaluation is based on historical data of 9 years from 2007 to 2015 of component stocks of China securities 100 index. Experimental results show that MV and omega models with RF return prediction, i.e., RF+MVF and RF+OF, outperform the other models. Further, RF+MVF is superior to RF+OF. Due to the high turnover of these two models, this paper discusses their performance after deducting the transaction fee cased by turnover. Experiments present that RF+MVF still performs the best among MVF models and omega model with SVR prediction (SVR+OF) performs the best among OF models. Moreover, RF+MVF performs better than SVR+OF and high turnover erodes nearly half of their total returns especially for RF+OF and RF+MVF. Therefore, this paper recommends investors to build MVF with RF return prediction for daily trading investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Financial trading; Machine learning; Portfolio optimization; Return prediction,Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Fintech; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Historical data; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio optimization models; Prediction model; Stock pre selections; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series models; Deep learning,"R.

However, there is a vast scope of machine learning approaches to predict future prices precisely. One of the major problems with previous research on BTC price predictions is that they are primarily empirical research lacking sufficient analytical support to back up the claims. Therefore, this study aims to solve the BTC price prediction problem in the context of both macroeconomic and microeconomic theories by applying new machine learning methods. Previous work, however, shows mixed evidence of the superiority of machine learning over statistical analysis and vice versa, so more research is needed. This paper applies comparative approaches, including ordinary least squares (OLS), Ensemble learning, support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), to investigate whether the macroeconomic, microeconomic, technical, and blockchain indicators based on economic theories predict the BTC price or not. The findings point out that some technical indicators are significant short-run BTC price predictors, thus confirming the validity of technical analysis. Moreover, macroeconomic and blockchain indicators are found to be significant long-term predictors, implying that supply, demand, and cost-based pricing theories are the underlying theories of BTC price prediction. Likewise, SVR is found to be superior to other machine learning and traditional models. This research’s innovation is looking at BTC price prediction through theoretical aspects. The overall findings show that SVR is superior to other machine learning models and traditional models. This paper has several contributions. It can contribute to international finance to be used as a reference for setting asset pricing and improved investment decision-making. It also contributes to the economics of BTC price prediction by introducing its theoretical background. Moreover, as the authors still doubt whether machine learning can beat the traditional methods in BTC price prediction, this research contributes to machine learning configuration and helping developers use it as a benchmark. © 2022 by the authors.",AI; business development; financial development; information processing; precision; volatility,,"Y.

As machine learning technique is advancing, new possibilities have opened up for incorporating prediction concepts into portfolio selection. A hybrid approach that constitutes machine learning algorithms for stock return prediction and a mean–VaR (value-at-risk) model for portfolio selection is illustrated in this paper as a unique portfolio construction technique. Machine learning regression models such as Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are adopted to forecast stock values for the next period. The stocks with greater prospective returns are chosen in the first stage of this affection.

Better portfolio optimization model can help investors earn more stable profits. This paper uses three deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP), long short memory (LSTM) neural network and convolutional neural network (CNN) to build prediction-based portfolio optimization models which own the advantages of both deep learning technology and modern portfolio theory. These models first use DNNs to predict each stock's future return. Then, predictive errors of DNNs are applied to measure the risk of each stock. Next, the portfolio optimization models are built by integrating the predictive returns and semi-absolute deviation of predictive errors. These models are compared with three equal weighted portfolios, where their stocks are selected by DMLP, LSTM neural network and CNN respectively. Also, two prediction-based portfolio models built with support vector regression are used as benchmarks. This paper applies component stocks of China securities 100 index in Chinese stock market as experimental data. Experimental results present that the prediction-based portfolio model based on DMLP performs the best among these models under different desired portfolio returns, and high desired portfolio return can further improve the performance of this model.

PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students’ feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive. When compared to other courses they have taken so far, students evaluate this experience as superior. © 2020",Gamification; MBA programs; Project portfolio management,,"M.W.

Recent research has made significant progress on stock ranking prediction to select top-ranked stocks for portfolio optimization. However, the stocks are only ranked by predicted stock return, ignoring the stock price volatility risk — a critical aspect for stock selection and investments. Moreover, they preliminarily attempted to capture the effects of related stocks from a singular relation, disregarding the rich information regarding multiple spillover effects from related stocks and the distinctions in effects among various relations. Thus, we propose a risk and return multi-task learning model with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HGA-MT) to predict stock ranking for portfolio optimization. First, to aggregate the multiple spillover effects of related stocks, we introduce graph convolutional networks to fuse the effects of related stocks in each relation and design an attention network to allocate varying weights to different types of relationships. Second, we use a multi-task learning paradigm to learn stock return and volatility risks jointly. The stock ranking results are calculated by simultaneously considering the risk and return. Thus, Top-K ranked stocks are recommended in the portfolio for the next trading day to achieve higher and more stable profits. Extensive experiments prove that HGA-MT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in stock ranking and backtesting trading evaluation tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Graph-based learning; Multi-task learning; Quantitative stock selection; Stock portfolio optimization; Stock relation graph,Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Learning systems; Profitability; Graph-based learning; Multitask learning; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative stock selection; Stock portfolio; Stock portfolio optimization; Stock relation graph; Stock returns; Stock selections; Volatility risks; Graphic methods,"E.

In contrast to classical stochastic control theory and other analytical approaches for solving financial decision-making problems that heavily reply on model assumptions, new developments from reinforcement learning (RL) are able to make full use of the large amount of financial data with fewer model assumptions and to improve decisions in complex financial environments. This survey paper aims to review the recent developments and use of RL approaches in finance. We give an introduction to Markov decision processes, which is the setting for many of the commonly used RL approaches. Various algorithms are then introduced with a focus on value- and policy-based methods that do not require any model assumptions. Connections are made with neural networks to extend the framework to encompass deep RL algorithms. We then discuss in detail the application of these RL algorithms in a variety of decision-making problems in finance, including optimal execution, portfolio optimization, option pricing and hedging, market making, smart order routing, and robo-advising. Our survey concludes by pointing out a few possible future directions for research. © 2023 The Authors. Mathematical Finance published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,,"R.

In the price prediction stage, it automatically assigns separate weights to the price relative predictions according to each asset's performance, and these weights will also be automatically updated. In the portfolio optimizing stage, a novel tracking system with a generalized increasing factor is proposed to maximize the future wealth of next period. Besides, an efficient algorithm is designed to solve the portfolio optimization objective, which is applicable to large-scale and time-limited situations. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from real financial markets with diverse assets and different time spans are conducted. RPRT outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in cumulative wealth, mean excess return, annual percentage yield, and some typical risk metrics. Moreover, it can withstand considerable transaction costs and runs fast. It indicates that RPRT is an effective and efficient APO system. © 2018 IEEE.",Automatic portfolio optimization (APO); generalized increasing factor; reweighted price relative (RPR); tracking system,Cybernetics; Information science; Investments; Learning systems; Optimization; Robustness (control systems); Tracking (position); generalized increasing factor; Portfolio optimization; Portfolios; reweighted price relative (RPR); Tracking system; Electronic trading,"P.-Y.

To allow agents to express a wide variety of risk-reward profiles, we assess the value of a policy using rank dependent expected utility (RDEU). RDEU allows agents to seek gains, while simultaneously protecting themselves against downside risk. To robustify optimal policies against model uncertainty, we assess a policy not by its distribution but rather by the worst possible distribution that lies within a Wasserstein ball around it. Thus, our problem formulation may be viewed as an actor/agent choosing a policy (the outer problem) and the adversary then acting to worsen the performance of that strategy (the inner problem). We develop explicit policy gradient formulae for the inner and outer problems and show their efficacy on three prototypical financial problems: robust portfolio allocation, benchmark optimization, and statistical arbitrage. © 2022 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics",portfolio optimization; reinforcement learning; risk measures; robust optimization; statistical arbitrage; Wasserstein distance,,,,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications,1945497X,,,,English,SIAM J.

Given the complex nature of portfolios comprising different genres that are studied separately from their respective disciplinary realms, the academic event portfolio landscape remains fragmented. This is against the nature of portfolios, which requires inter-disciplinarity and novel integration of genres, stakeholders and perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a scoping literature review, this conceptual paper sets up a common ground for the academic study and industrial development of event portfolio management. Findings: A comprehensive view of event portfolio literature across disciplines reveals its hypostasis as a compound transdisciplinary field. The authors suggest a set of foundational premises whereby they identify 22 principal thematic areas that comprise this emerging field. Practical implications: The establishment of event portfolio management as a distinct field will help in the osmosis and diffusion of new ideas, models and best practices to run and leverage portfolios. The portfolio perspective highlights the need for cohesive learning to design comprehensive systems of events, implement joint strategies, solidify social networks, coordinate multiple stakeholders and develop methods of holistic evaluation. Originality/value: By examining comprehensively event portfolio management as a transdisciplinary field, the authors have been able to identify principal research directions and priorities. This comprehensive analysis provides a synergistic ground, which at this embryonic stage of development, can be used to set out joint trajectories and reciprocal foci across the whole span of scholarship studying planned series of events. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Destination management; Event leveraging; Event management; Event portfolio; Eventfulness; Place-making,,"V.

We define this as shared influence on instructional leadership and school-wide decision making, which research suggests have strong ties to student achievement and teacher commitment. Method: We analyze interview data from 53 administrators, teacher leaders, and teachers in eight case study schools and teacher surveys in 48 schools. In both data sets, we purposively sampled based on variance in school performance ratings and by school type (e.g., traditional public, standalone charter, charter management organization [CMO], and innovation schools). Findings: We find that perceptions of shared instructional leadership were generally high across the school contexts, though CMO and innovation schools had the highest perceptions in both the survey and case study data. Schools varied substantially in shared decision making, but innovation schools had higher average scores than other school models. Centralized policies and supports, alongside organizational visions spanning networks of schools, helped explain the enactment of shared leadership for learning. For example, schools within Denver’s “innovation” network shared a common vision of teacher empowerment, while CMOs that had more prescribed policies and practices across their schools had lower reported levels of shared decision making. Implications for Research and Practice: Portfolio management models that prioritize school-based autonomy and choice between different kinds of schools are proliferating in urban areas. Our study helps explain why and how shared leadership for learning differs between school models and explores important implications for this variation. © The Author(s) 2020.",charter management organizations; instructional leadership; portfolio management models; school-wide decision making; shared leadership; teacher influence,,"A.C.

Therefore, the forecast of exchange rates has always been of great interest among academics, economic agents, and institutions. However, exchange rate series are essentially dynamic and nonlinear in nature and thus, forecasting exchange rates is a difficult task. On the other hand, deep learning models in solving time series forecasting tasks have been proposed in the last half-decade. But the number of formal comparative study in terms of exchange rate forecasting with deep learning models is quite limited. For this purpose, this study applies ten different models (Random Walk, Autoregressive Moving Average, Threshold Autoregression, Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average, Support Vector Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit and Autoregressive Moving Average-Long Short Term Memory Hybrid Models) and two forecasting modes (recursive and rolling window) to predict three major exchange rate returnsnamely, the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound against the US Dollar in monthly terms. To evaluate the forecasting performances of the models, we used Model Confidence Set procedure as an advanced test. According to our results, the proposed hybrid model produced the best out-of-sample forecast performance in all samples, without exception. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deep learning; Exchange rates; Forecasting; Hybrid model,,"F.M.

By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart ""Predict, then Optimize"" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure-that is, its objective and constraints-for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This problem has been studied and different models have been proposed since the classical Mean-Variance model was introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952 and the later modified version by William Sharpe. The inclusion of real-life constraints to the problem has led to the introduction of the extended Mean-Variance model. However, the successes of nature-inspired algorithms in hard computational optimization problems have encouraged researchers to design and apply these algorithms for a variety of optimization problems. In this paper, we design and adapt a Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) for the unconstrained and constrained portfolio optimization problems. SSA is a very recent swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the dynamic foraging behavior of flying squirrels. The proposed SSA metaheuristic approach is compared with a variety of approaches presented in the literature such as classical single metaheuristics, hybrid metaheuristic approaches and multi-objective optimization approaches for portfolio optimization. Comparative analysis and computational results using different performance indicators show the superiority of the proposed approach for the unconstrained portfolio optimization using both extended Mean-Variance and Sharpe models. For the constrained version of the problem, the proposed approach has also achieved highly competitive results for the different models adopted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Markowitz; Mean-variance; Portfolio optimization; Sharpe; Squirrel search algorithm; Swarm Intelligence,Constrained optimization; Financial data processing; Multiobjective optimization; Swarm intelligence; Markowitz; Mean variance; Mean variance model; Meta-heuristic approach; Optimization problems; Portfolio optimization; Search Algorithms; Sharpe; Squirrel search algorithm; Swarm intelligence; Learning algorithms,"M.

It has been utilized in many areas owing to its strong potential. For example, it has been widely used in the financial area which is vital to the society, such as high-frequency trading, portfolio optimization, fraud detection and risk management. Stock market prediction is one of the most popular and valuable areas in finance. In this paper, it proposes a stock prediction model using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) used as a generator that inputs historical stock price and generates future stock price and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a discriminator to discriminate between the real stock price and generated stock price. Different from the traditional methods, which limited the forecasting on one-step-ahead only, by contrast, using the deep learning algorithm is possible to conduct the multi-step ahead prediction more accurately. In this study, it chose the Apple Inc. stock closing price as the target price, with features such as S&P 500 index, NASDAQ Composite index, U.S. Dollar index, etc. In addition, FinBert has been utilized to generate a news sentiment index for Apple Inc. as an additional predicting feature. Finally, this paper compares the proposed GAN model results with the baseline model. © 2021 HungChun Lin, Chen Chen, GaoFeng Huang and Amir Jafari.

However, few empirical studies have considered the inclusion of the newly emerged commodity asset in the global commodity market. It is of great importance for investors and policymakers to take advantage of this asset and its potential benefits by incorporating it as a part of the broad commodity trading portfolio. In this study, we propose a novel ensemble portfolio optimization (NEPO) framework utilized for broad commodity assets, which integrates a hybrid variational mode decomposition-bidirectional long short-term memory deep learning model for future returns forecast and a reinforcement learning-based model for optimizing the asset weight allocation. Our empirical results indicate that the NEPO framework could effectively improve the prediction accuracy and trend prediction ability across various commodity assets from different sectors. In addition, it could effectively incorporate Bitcoins into the asset pool and achieve better financial performance compared to traditional asset allocation strategies, commodity funds, and indices. © 2021, The Author(s).",Bitcoin; Deep learning; Portfolio optimization; Reinforcement learning; Variational mode decomposition,,"Y.

To mitigate the effects of estimation risk, we employ the Bayes-Stein model with no short-selling and variance-based constraints. We estimate the inputs using lasso regression and elastic net regression, employing the shrunk Wishart stochastic volatility model and Gaussian random projection. We consider nine cryptocurrency asset categories, and find that all but two provide significant out-of-sample diversification benefits. The lower is investor risk aversion, the more beneficial are cryptocurrencies as portfolio diversifiers. During uncertain economic environments, such as the post-Covid-19 period, cryptocurrencies provide the same diversification benefits as in more stable environments.

Key contributions are in terms of assessing the importance of energy cryptos as alternative investments in portfolio management, and whether different volatility models such as autoregressive moving average – Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) and machine learning (ML) can help investors make better investment decisions. The methodology utilizes the traditional Markowitz mean-variance framework to obtain optimized portfolio combinations. Volatility measures, derived from the Cornish-Fisher adjusted variance, ARMA family classes and ML models are used to compare efficient portfolios. The study also analyses the effect of adding cryptos to equity portfolios with non-positive excess returns. Different models are assessed using the Sharpe performance measure. Daily data is used, spanning from November 21, 2017 to January 31, 2019. Findings suggest that energy based cryptos do not have a significant impact on energy equity portfolios, despite the use of different risk measures. This is attributable to the relatively poor performance of energy cryptos which did not contribute in improving the excess return per unit of risk of efficient portfolios based on the leading US energy stocks. © 2020, Econjournals.

Therefore, this study investigates whether formal credit promotes entrepreneurial farmers’ e-commerce utilization and explores its influencing mechanism. Based on the survey data collected from 831 entrepreneurial farmers in Shaanxi province, Ningxia province and Shandong province in rural China, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was applied to measure the impact of formal credit on e-commerce utilization. The results show that formal credit contributes to a 18.41% increase of e-commerce utilization in general and increases entrepreneurial farmers’ online purchases and sales by 11.15% and 14.69%, respectively. Some groups perform significantly in the heterogeneity analysis, the most noteworthy of which are entrepreneurial farmers who are younger, belong to new type of agricultural business entities and use mobile payments. Their e-commerce utilization, including online purchases and sales, are impacted most by formal credit. Furthermore, when the bootstrap method was used to examine the mediating effect, we found that formal credit has a positive and significant effect on the utilization of e-commerce through four channels, which are internet learning, asset allocation, labor allocation and income growth. Hence, the findings suggest that the government should augment the amount of formal credit to optimize entrepreneurial farmers’ internet learning, asset allocation, labor employment and income growth, thereby promoting e-commerce to achieve entrepreneurial transformation and sustainable development in rural areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent agent-based models usually contain a large number of parameters that capture the interactions among microheterogeneous subjects and the multistructure of the complex system. However, this can result in the ""curse of dimensionality"" phenomenon and decrease the robustness of the model's output. Hence, it is still a great challenge to efficiently calibrate agent-based models to actual data. In this paper, we present a surrogate analysis method for calibration by combining supervised machine-learning and intelligent iterative sampling. Without any prior assumptions regarding the distribution of the parameter space, the proposed method can learn a surrogate model as the approximation of the original system with a relatively small number of training points, which will serve the needs of further sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration research. We take the heterogeneous asset pricing model as an example to evaluate the model's performance using actual Chinese stock market data. The results demonstrate the good capabilities of the surrogate model at modelling the observed reality, as well as the remarkable reduction of the computational time for validating the agent-based model. © 2020 Yi Zhang et al.",,,"Y.
